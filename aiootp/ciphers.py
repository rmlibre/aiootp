        This function is copied into the ``Comprende`` class dictionary.
        Doing so allows instances of ``Comprende`` generators access to
        a baked-in, pseudo-one-time-pad decryption algorithm for binary
        data, while also keeping encapsulation of code & functionality.

        Once copied, the ``self`` argument becomes a reference to an
        instance of ``Comprende``. With that, now all generators that
        are decorated with ``comprehension`` can decrypt valid streams
        of pseudo-one-time-pad encrypted ciphertext of bytes type data.

        ``key``: An aribrary amount & type of entropic material whose
                __repr__ function returns the user's desired entropy &
                cryptographic strength. Designed to be used as a longer-
                term user encryption / decryption key.

        ``salt``: An ephemeral 256-bit random hexidecimal string that
                MUST BE USED ONLY ONCE for each encryption. This value
                is sent in the clear along with the ciphertext.

        ``pid``: An arbitrary value whose __repr__ function returns any
                value that a user decides to categorize keystreams. It
                safely differentiates those keystreams & initially was
                designed to permute parallelized keystreams derived from
                the same ``key`` & ``salt``. Since this value is now
                verified during message authentication, it can be used
                to verify arbitrary additional data.

        WARNING: This generator does not provide authentication of the
        ciphertexts or associated data it handles. Nor does it do any
        message padding or checking of inputs for adequacy. Those are
        functionalities which must be obtained through other means. Just
        passing in a ``validator`` will not authenticate ciphertext
        itself. The `finalize` or `afinalize` methods must be called on
        the ``validator`` once all of the cipehrtext has been created /
        decrypted. Then the final HMAC is available from the `aresult`
        & `result` methods, & can be tested against untrusted HMACs
        with the `atest_hmac` & `test_hmac` methods. The validator
        also has `current_digest` & `acurrent_digest` methods that can
        be used to authenticate unfinished streams of cipehrtext.

            load all of the stored database values from the filesystem
            into the cache during initialization, or -- False -- skip
            the loading stage. This can save time up front so users can

    Ratcheting Opaque Password Authenticated Key Exchange

    An implementation of a password-authenticated key exchange protocol
    for servers to securely authenticate users & users to authenticate
    servers. User passwords aren't disclosed to the servers. They are
    used to build persistently secure connection keys which are made
    future & forward secure with a new elliptic curve diffie-hellman
    shared key being used for every authentication & mixed with keys
    established from past authentications. The protocol requires that
