aiootp - Asynchronous pseudo-one-time-pad based crypto and anonymity library.
=============================================================================

``aiootp`` is an asynchronous library providing access to cryptographic 
primatives and abstractions, transparently encrypted / decrypted file 
I/O and databases, as well as powerful, pythonic utilities that 
simplify data processing & cryptographic procedures in python code. 
This library's cipher is an implementation of the **pseudo-one-time-pad**. 
The aim is to create a simple, standard, efficient implementation that's 
indistinguishable from the unbreakable one-time-pad cipher; to give 
users and applications access to user-friendly cryptographic tools; 
and, to increase the overall security, privacy, and anonymity on the web, 
and in the digital world. Users will find ``aiootp`` to be easy to write, 
easy to read, and fun. 




Important Disclaimer
--------------------

``aiootp`` is experimental software that works with Python 3.6+. 
It's a work in progress. The programming API could change with 
future updates, and it isn't bug free. ``aiootp`` provides powerful 
security tools and misc utilities that're designed to be 
developer-friendly and privacy preserving. 
As a security tool, ``aiootp`` needs to be tested and reviewed 
extensively by the programming and cryptography communities to 
ensure its implementations are sound. We provide no guarantees. 
This software hasn't yet been audited by third-party security 
professionals. 




Quick install
-------------

``pip3 install --user --upgrade aiootp``




Some Examples

Users can create and modify transparently encrypted databases:

Let's take a deep dive into the low-level xor procedure used to implement the pseudo-one-time-pad:

.. code-block:: python

    #
    
    import aiootp
    
    # It is a ``Comprende`` generator ->
    
    @aiootp.comprehension()
    
    # ``data`` is an iterable of 256 byte integers that are either plaintext
    
    # or ciphertext. ``key`` should be an instance of the ``keys`` generator. 
    
    # And, ``validator`` should be an instance of the ``StreamHMAC`` class. ->
    
    def xor(data, *, key, validator):
        
        keystream = key.send
        
        # We use the first output of the keystream as a seed of entropy
        
        # for all future key chunks pulled from the generator ->
        
        seed = aiootp.sha_256(keystream(None))
        
        for chunk in data:
            
            # We contantenate two 128 byte key chunks together ->
            
            key_chunk = int(await keystream(seed) + await keystream(seed), 16)
            
            # Then xor the 256 byte key chunk with the 256 byte data chunk 
            
            # and use the validator to update the HMAC with the ciphertext ->
            
            result = validator.validated_xor(chunk, key_chunk)
            
            if result.bit_length() > 2048:
                
                # If the result is for some reason larger than 256 bytes,
                
                # we abort the procedure, & warn the user ->
                
                raise ValueError("Data MUST NOT exceed 256 bytes.")
                
           # Then we yield the result ->
           
            yield result
            
    # This is a very space-efficient algorithm for a pseudo-one-time-pad that 
    
    # adapts dynamically to increased plaintext & ciphertext sizes. Both because 
    
    # it's built on generators, & because an infinite stream of key material
    
    # can efficiently be produced from a finite-sized key & an ephemeral salt.
    
    # This version of the algorithm is much simpler & much more efficient 
    
    # than that from previous versions.
    
    
    #




Here's a quick overview of this package's modules:

.. code-block:: python

    # Commonly used constants, datasets & functionality across all modules ->
    
    aiootp.commons
    
    
    # The basic utilities & abstractions of the package's architecture ->
    
    aiootp.generics
    
    
    # This module is responsible for providing entropy to the package ->
    
    aiootp.randoms
    
    
    # The higher-level abstractions used to implement the pseudo-one-time pad ->
    
    aiootp.ciphers
    
    
    # The higher-level abstractions used to create / manage key material ->
    
    aiootp.keygens
    
    
    # Common system paths & the ``pathlib.Path`` utility ->
    
    aiootp.paths
    
    
    # Global async functionalities & abstractions ->
    
    aiootp.asynchs
    
    
    # Decorators & classes able to benchmark async/sync functions & generators ->
    
    aiootp.debuggers
