Description: aiootp - Asynchronous one-time-pad based crypto and anonymity library.
        ======================================================================
        
        ``aiootp`` is an asynchronous library providing access to cryptographic 
        primatives and abstractions, transparently encrypted / decrypted file 
        I/O and databases, as well as powerful, pythonic utilities that 
        simplify data processing & cryptographic procedures in python code. 
        This library's cipher is an implementation of the **one-time pad**. 
        The aim is to create a simple, standard, efficient implementation of 
        this unbreakable cipher, to give users and applications access to 
        user-friendly cryptographic tools, and to increase the overall 
        security, privacy, and anonymity on the web, and in the digital world. 
        Users will find ``aiootp`` to be easy to write, easy to read, and fun. 
        
        
        
        
        Important Disclaimer
        --------------------
        
        ``aiootp`` is experimental software that works with Python 3.6+. 
        It's a work in progress. The programming API could change with 
        future updates, and it isn't bug free. ``aiootp`` provides powerful 
        security tools and misc utilities that're designed to be 
        developer-friendly and privacy preserving. 
        As a security tool, ``aiootp`` needs to be tested and reviewed 
        extensively by the programming and cryptography communities to 
        ensure its implementations are sound. We provide no guarantees. 
        This software hasn't yet been audited by third-party security 
        professionals.

        Let's take a deep dive into the low-level xor procedure used to implement the one-time-pad:

            # ``data`` is an iterable of 256 byte integers that are either plaintext
            
            # or ciphertext. ``key`` is by default the ``keys`` generator. ->
            
            def xor(data=None, *, key=None):
                
                keystream = key.send
                
                # We use the first output of the keystream as a seed of entropy
                
                # for all key chunks pulled from the generator ->
                
                seed = aiootp.sha_256(keystream(None))
                
                for chunk in data:
                    
                    # We contantenate two 128 byte key chunks together ->
                    
                    key_chunk = int(await keystream(seed) + await keystream(seed), 16)
                    
                    # Then xor the 256 byte key chunk with the 256 byte data chunk ->

                        # If the result is for some reason larger than 256 bytes,
                        
                        # we abort the procedure, & warn the user ->
                        
                        raise ValueError("Data MUST NOT exceed 256 bytes.")
                        
                   # Then we yield the result ->
                   
                    yield result
                    
            # This is a very space-efficient algorithm for a one-time-pad that adapts
            
            # dynamically to increased plaintext & ciphertext sizes. Both because 
            
            # it's built on generators, & because an infinite stream of key material
            
            # can efficiently be produced from a finite-sized key & an ephemeral salt.

        FAQ
        ---
        
        **Q: What is the one-time-pad?**
        
        A: It's a provably unbreakable cipher. It's typically thought to be too cumbersome a cipher because it has strict requirements. Key size is one requirement, since keys must be at least as large as the plaintext in order to ensure this unbreakability. We've simplified this requirement by using a forward secret and semi-future secret key ratchet algorithm, with ephemeral salts for each stream, allowing users to securely produce endless streams of key material as needed from a single finite size 512-bit long-term key. This algorithmic approach lends itself to great optimizations, since hash processing hardware/sorftware is continually pushed to the edges of efficiency.
        
        
        **Q: What do you mean the ``aiootp.keys`` generator produces forward & semi-future secure key material?**
        
        A: The infinite stream of key material produced by that generator has amazing properties. Under the hood it's a ``hashlib.sha3_512`` key ratchet algorithm. It's internal state consists of a seed hash, & three ``hashlib.sha3_512`` objects primed iteratively with the one prior and the seed hash. The first object is updated with the seed, its prior output, and the entropy that may be sent into the generator as a coroutine. This first object is then used to update the last two objects before yielding the last two's concatenated results. The seed is the hash of a primer seed, which itself is the hash of the input key material, a random salt, and a user-defined ID value which can safely distinguish streams with the same key material. This algorithm is forward secure because compromising a future key will not compromise past keys since these hashes are irreversibly constructed. It's also semi-future secure since having a past key doesn't allow you to compute future keys without also compromising the seed hash, and the first ratcheting ``hashlib`` object. Since those two states are never disclosed or used for encryption, the key material produced is future secure with respect to itself only. Full future-security would allow for the same property even if the seed & ratchet object's state were compromised. This feature can, however, be added to the algorithm since the generator itself can receive entropy externally from a user at any arbitrary point in its execution, say, after computing a shared diffie-hellman exchange key.
        
        
        **Q: How fast is this implementation of the one-time pad cipher?** 
        
        A: Well, because it relies on ``hashlib.sha3_512`` hashing to build key material streams, it's rather efficient, encrypting & decrypting about 8 MB/s on a ~1.5 GHz core.
        
        
        **Q: Why make a new cipher when AES is strong enough?** 
        
        A: Although primatives like AES are strong enough for now, there's no guarantee that future hardware or algorithms won't be developed that break them. In fact, AES's theoretical bit-strength has dropped over the years because of hardware and algorithmic developments. It's still considered a secure cipher, but the **one-time pad** isn't considered theoretically "strong enough", instead it's mathematically proven to be unbreakable. Such a cryptographic guarantee is too profound not to develop further into an efficient, accessible standard.
        
        
        **Q: What size keys does this one-time pad cipher use?** 
        
        A: It's been designed to work with 512-bit hexidecimal keys. 
        
        
        **Q: What's up with the ``AsyncDatabase`` / ``Database``?**
        
        A: The idea is to create an intuitive, pythonic interface to a transparently encrypted and decrypted persistence tool that also cryptographically obscures metadata. It's designed to work with json serializable data, which gives it native support for some basic python datatypes. It needs improvement with regard to disk memory efficiency. So, it's still a work in progress, albeit a very nifty one.
        
        
        **Q: Why are the modules transformed into ``Namespace`` objects?**
        
        A: We overwrite our modules in this package to have a more fine-grained control over what part of the package's internal state is exposed to users and applications. The goal is make it more difficult for users to inadvertently jeopardize their security tools, and minimize the attack surface available to adversaries. The ``aiootp.Namespace`` class also makes it easier to coordinate and decide the library's UI/UX across the package.

        ``Changelog``
        =============
        
        
        Changes for version 0.17.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: The HMAC verifiers on ciphertexts did not include 
           the ``salt`` or ``pid`` values when deriving the HMAC. This 
           associated data can therefore be changed to cause a party to
           decrypt a past ciphertext with a salt or pid of an attacker's
           choosing. This is a critical vulnerability & it is highly recommended
           all users update. The fix is to hash the ciphertext, ``salt`` 
           & ``pid`` together & sending that hash into the validator to have
           the HMAC created / tested. This change will cause all prior 
           ciphertexts to be marked invalid by the validator.
        -  Refactored the names of the Comprende cipher methods to better 
           communicate their intended use as lower level tools that cannot be
           used on their own to obtain authenticated, CCA or CPA secure 
           encryption.
        -  Added more comprehensive tests for ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes,
           as well as the protocols that utilize the ``X25519`` ecdh exchange.
           Fixed some bugs in the process.
        -  ``X25519`` instances that contain a secret key now have access to
           protocol methods which automatically pass their key in as a keyword
           argument. This simplifies their usage further.
        -  Incorporated the new ``Hasher`` class into the package's random
           number generator to improve its entropy production.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various fixes to typos, docstrings & tutorials.
        -  New tutorials & docs added.
        -  Changed the default table in ``ByteIO`` 's ``json_to_ascii``, ``ajson_to_ascii``,
           ``ascii_to_json`` & ``aascii_to_json`` to the ``URL_SAFE_TABLE`` to 
           facilitate the creation of urlsafe_tokens.
        -  Removed all code in the ``Ropake`` class that was used to create a default
           database to store a default salt for users. All of that functionality 
           is expected to be handled by the database classes' token & profile 
           creation tools.
        -  Fixed bug in package signing script that called hex from a string.
        -  Updated the package signing script to include these metadata in the
           signatures of the ephemeral keys: name of the package, version, the 
           date in seconds.
        -  Added metadata to the ``setup.cfg`` file.
        -  Make passcrypt objects available from the ``keygens`` module.
        -  Add more consistent ability within ``Ropake`` class to specify a
           time-to-live for protocol messages.
        -  Added check to make sure instances of ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` are
           not trying to import a new secret key once they already have one. 
           This won't be allowed in favor of creating a new object for a new
           secret key.
        -  Fixed bug in database classes' bytes ciphers which called themselves
           recursively instead of calling the global functions of the same name.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.16.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  All ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` filenames have been converted to
           base36 to aid in making the manifest files & the databases as a whole 
           more space efficient. These changes are not backwards compatible.
        -  More work was done to clean up the databases & make them more 
           efficient, as well as equalize the sizes of the database files to
           mitigate leaking metadata about what they might contain. 
        -  Added new ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes that greatly simplify the
           usage of the cryptography module's 25519 based tools. They also help
           organize the codebase better -- where ``Ropake`` was holding onto
           all of the asymmetric tooling even though those tools were not part
           of the Ropake protocol.
        -  New base & helper ``Asymmetric25519`` & ``BaseEllipticCurve`` classes 
           were added as well to facilitate the reorganization.
        -  Many methods in ``Ropake`` were turned private to simplify & clean up 
           the interface so its intended use as a protocol is more clear for users.
        -  Added the time-to-live functionality to ``Ropake`` decryption functions.
           The ``TIMEOUT`` attribute on the class can also be changed to import 
           a global time-to-live for all ``Ropake`` ciphertexts.
        -  Removed all ``nc_`` hash functions from the package/generics.py module.
        -  The ``Namespace`` class now has a ``keys`` method so that namespaces
           can be unpacked using star-star syntax.
        -  Because of the ongoing failures of gnupg, we are moving away from 
           signing our packages with gnupg. Our new Ed25519 keys will be from
           the cryptography package, & we'll sign those with our gnupg key as a
           secondary form of attestation. Our package signing will be automated
           in the setup.py file & the methods we use will be transparent in the 
           code. The new signatures for each package version will be placed in 
           the file ``SIGNATURES.txt``.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Many fixes & additions to docstrings & tutorials.
        -  Massive refactorings, cleanups & typo fixes across the library, 
           especially in the database classes, ``Ropake`` & the ``ciphers`` module.
        -  Added comprehensive functional tests for the Ropake class.
        -  Added ``BASE_36_TABLE`` to the ``commons`` module.
        -  Fixed metadata issues in setup.py that caused upload issues to pypi.
        -  The ``generate_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``agenerate_profile`` &
           ``aload_profile`` database methods now accept arbitrary keyword arguments 
           that get passed into the database's __init__ constructor.
        -  ``username`` & ``password`` are now required keyword-only arguments
           to the ``agenerate_profile_tokens`` & ``generate_profile_tokens`` 
           classmethods.
        -  The ``aload`` & ``load`` database methods now take a ``manifest`` kwarg
           that when toggled ``True`` will also refresh the manifest file from 
           disk.
        -  Now when a database object is ordered to delete itself, the entirety 
           of the instance's caches & attribute values are cleared & deleted.
        -  Filled out the references to strong key generators & protocols in the
           ``keygens`` module.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.15.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: The previous update left the default salt stored by
           the ``Ropake`` class on the user filesystem as an empty string  for
           new files that were created since the ``asalt`` & ``salt`` functions
           were switched to producing 256-bit values instead of 512-bits. This
           bug has now been fixed.
        -  An 8 byte timestamp is now prepended to each plaintext during the
           padding step. The decryption functions now take a ``ttl`` kwarg which
           will measure & enforce a time-to-live for ciphertexts under threat of
           ``TimeoutError``.
        -  Added new profile feature to the database classes. This standardizes
           & simplifies the process for users to open databases using only 
           low-entropy "profile" information such as ``username``, ``password``,
           ``*credentials`` & an optional ``salt`` a user may have access to. 
           The new ``agenerate_profile_tokens``, ``generate_profile_tokens``, 
           ``agenerate_profile``, ``generate_profile``, ``aprofile_exists``, 
           ``profile_exists``, ``aload_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``adelete_profile``
           & ``delete_profile`` functions are the public part of this new feature.
        -  Some more database class attributes have been turned private to clean
           up the api.
        -  Fixed typo in ``__exit__`` method of ``Database`` class which referenced 
           a method which had its name refactored, leading to a crash.
        -  Shifted the values in the ``primes`` dictionary such that the key for
           each element in the dictionary is the exclusive maximum of each prime
           in that element. Ex: primes[512][-1].to_bytes(64, "big") is now valid.
           Whereas before, primes[512] was filled with primes that were 64 bytes
           and 1 bit long, making them 65 byte primes. This changes some of the
           values of constants in the package & therefore some values derived 
           from those constants.
        -  Slimmed down the number of elements in the ``primes`` & ``bits`` 
           dictionaries, reducing the size of the package a great deal. ``primes``
           now contains two primes in each element, the first is the minimum 
           prime of that bit length, the latter the maximum.
        -  Added ``URLSAFE_TABLE`` to the package.
        -  Made ``salt`` & ``pid`` & ``ttl`` keyword only arguments in key 
           generators & encryption / decryption functions, further tighening up
           the api.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``this_second`` function to ``asynchs`` module for integer time.
        -  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & 
           ``plaintext_stream`` functions to the ``ciphers`` module.
        -  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key`` to the ``keygens`` module &
           ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes.
        -  Added ``axi_mix``, ``xi_mix``, ``acheck_timestamp``, ``check_timestamp``,
           to the ``generics`` module.
        -  Added ``acsprbg``, ``csprbg``, ``asalt``, ``salt``, ``apadding_key``, 
           ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & ``plaintext_stream`` functions
           to OneTimePad class as ``staticmethod`` & instance methods.
        -  Added ``acheck_timestamp`` & ``check_timestamp`` functions to the 
           ``BytesIO`` class.
        -  Added ``adeniable_filename`` & ``deniable_filename`` to the ``paths`` 
           module. 
        -  Removed check for falsey data in encryption functions. Empty data is 
           & should be treated as valid plaintext.
        -  Various refactorings, docstring fixes & efficiency improvements.
        -  Added some new tests for database profiles.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.14.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security patch: The ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` &
           ``depad_bytes`` functions were changed internally to execute in a
           more constant time. The variations were small for 256-byte buffers
           (the default), but can grow very wide with larger buffers. The salt
           in the package's encryption utilities is now used to derive the 
           plaintext's padding, making each padding unique. 
        -  Unified the types of encodings the library's encryption functions
           utilize for producing ciphertext. This includes databases. They now
           all use the ``LIST_ENCODING``. This greatly increases the efficiency
           of the databases' encryption/decryption, save/load times. And this
           encoding is more space efficient. This change is backwards
           incompatible.
        -  The ``LIST_ENCODING`` specification was also changed to produce
           smaller ciphertexts. The salt is no longer encrypted & included as
           the first 256 byte chunk of ciphertext. It is now packaged along with
           ciphertext in the clear & is restricted to being a 256-bit hex
           string.
        -  The interfaces for the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` were cleaned
           up. Many attributes & functions that were not intended as the public
           interface of the classes were made "private". Also, the no longer
           used utilities for encrypting & decrypting under the MAP_ENCODING
           were removed.
        -  Updated the ``abytes_xor``, ``bytes_xor``, ``axor`` & ``xor`` generators 
           to shrink the size of the ``seed`` that's fed into the ``keystream``. This
           allows the one-time-pad cipher to be more cpu efficient.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Fixed various typos, docstrings & tutorials that have no kept up
           with the pace of changes.
        -  Various refactorings throughout.
        -  The ``akeypair`` & ``keypair`` functions now produce a ``Namespace``
           populated with a 512-bit hex key & a 256-bit hex salt to be more
           consistent with their intended use-case with the one-time-pad cipher.
        -  Removed ``aencode_salt``, ``encode_salt``, ``adecode_salt`` & 
           ``decode_salt`` functions since they are no longer used in conjunction
           with LIST_ENCODING ciphertexts.
        -  Updated tests to recognize these changes.
        -  Gave the ``OneTimePad`` class access to a ``BytesIO`` object under a
           new ``io`` attribute.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.13.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: ``xor`` & ``axor`` functions that define the 
           one-time-pad cipher had a vulnerability fixed that can leak <1-bit of
           plaintext. The issue was in the way keys were built, where the
           multiplicative products of two key segments were xor'd together. This
           lead to keys being slightly more likely to be positive integers, 
           meaning the final bit had a greater than 1/2 probability of being a 
           ``0``. The fix is accompanied with an overhaul of the one-time-pad 
           cipher which is more efficient, faster, & designed with a better 
           understanding of the way bytes are processed & represented. The key
           chunks now do not, & must not, surpass 256 bytes & neither should 
           any chunk of plaintext output. Making each chunk deterministically 
           256 bytes allows for reversibly formatting ciphertext to & from 
           bytes-like strings. These changes are backwards incompatible with 
           prior versions of this package & are strongly recommended.
        -  Added ``bytes_xor`` & ``abytes_xor`` functions which take in key 
           generators which produce key segments of type bytes instead of hex 
           strings.
        -  ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now save files in bytes format,
           making them much more efficient on disk space. They use the new
           ``BytesIO`` class in the ``generics`` module to transparently convert
           to & from json & bytes. This change is also not backwards compatible.
        -  Removed ``acipher``, ``cipher``, ``adecipher``, ``decipher``,
           ``aorganize_encryption_streams``, ``organize_encryption_streams``,
           ``aorganize_decryption_streams``, ``organize_decryption_streams``,
           ``aencrypt``, ``encrypt``, ``adecrypt``, ``decrypt``, ``asubkeys`` &
           ``subkeys`` generators from the ``ciphers`` module & package to slim 
           down the code, remove repetition & focus on the cipher tools that 
           include hmac authentication.
        -  Removed deprecated diffie-hellman methods in ``Ropake`` class. 
        -  Removed the static ``power10`` dictionary from the package.
        -  The default secret salt for the ``Ropake`` class is now derived from the 
           contents of a file that's in the databases directory which is chmod'd to 
           0o000 unless needed. 
        -  Made ``aclient_message_key``, ``client_message_key``, ``aserver_message_key``, 
           & ``server_message_key`` ``Ropake`` class methods to help distinguish 
           client-to-server & server-to-client message keys which prevents replay 
           attacks on the one-message ROPAKE protocol. 
        -  Added protocol coroutines to the ``Ropake`` class which allow for easily
           engaging in 2DH & 3DH elliptic curve exchanges for servers & clients.
        -  Efficiency improvements to the ``aseeder`` & ``seeder`` generator functions
           in the ``randoms`` module. This affects the ``acsprng`` & ``csprng`` objects
           & all the areas in the library that utilize those objects.
        -  Changed the repr behavior of ``Comprende`` instances to redact all args &
           kwargs by default to protect cryptographic material from unintentionally
           being displayed on user systems. The repr can display full contents by 
           calling the ``enable_debugging`` method of the ``DebugControl`` class.
        -  All generator functions decorated with ``comprehension`` are now given
           a ``root`` attribute. This allows direct access to the function without
           needing to instantiate or run it as a ``Comprende`` object. This saves 
           a good deal of cpu & time in the overhead that would otherwise be 
           incurred by the class. This is specifically more helpful in tight &/or
           lower-level looping.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings across the library. 
        -  Fixed various typos, bugs & inaccurate docstrings throughout the library.
        -  Add ``chown`` & ``chmod`` functions to the ``asynchs.aos`` module. 
        -  Now makes new ``multiprocessing.Manager`` objects in the ``asynchs.Processes`` 
           & ``asynchs.Threads`` classes to avoid errors that occur when using a stale 
           object whose socket connections are closed. 
        -  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``adb_login`` & ``db_login`` methods to 
           ``adatabase_login_key`` & ``database_login_key``. Also, fix a crash bug in 
           those methods. 
        -  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``aec25519_pub``, ``ec25519_pub``, ``aec25519_priv`` 
           & ``ec25519_priv`` methods to ``aec25519_public_bytes``, ``ec25519_public_bytes``, 
           ``aec25519_private_bytes`` & ``ec25519_private_bytes``. 
        -  Added low-level private methods to ``Ropake`` class which do derivation 
           & querying of the default class key & salt. 
        -  Behavior changes to the ``ainverse_int`` & ``inverse_int`` functions in the 
           ``generics`` module to allow handling bases represented in ``str`` or ``bytes`` 
           type strings. 
        -  Behavior & name changes to the ``abinary_tree`` & ``binary_tree`` functions in the 
           ``generics`` module to ``abuild_tree`` & ``build_tree``. They now allow making 
           uniform trees of any width & depth, limited only by the memory in a 
           user's machine. 
        -  Provided new ``acsprbg`` & ``csprbg`` objects to the library that return 512-bits 
           of cryptographically secure pseudo-random ``bytes`` type strings. They are 
           made by the new ``abytes_seeder`` & ``bytes_seeder`` generators. 
        -  The ``csprng``, ``acsprng``, ``csprbg`` & ``acsprbg`` objects were 
           wrapped in functions that automatically restart the generators if they're
           stalled / interrupted during a call. This keeps the package from melting
           down if it can no longer call the CSPRNGs for new entropy.
        -  Cleaned up & simplified ``table_key`` functions in the ``keygens`` module. 
        -  Changed the output of ``asafe_symm_keypair`` & ``safe_symm_keypair`` functions 
           to contain bytes values not their hex-only representation. Also removed 
           these functions from the main imports of the package since they are slow 
           & their main contribution is calling ``arandom_number_generator`` & 
           ``random_number_generator`` to utilize a large entropy pool when starting
           CSPRNGs.
        -  Added new values to the ``bits`` dictionary.
        -  Added ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` & ``depad_bytes``
           functions which use ``shake_256`` to pad/depad plaintext bytes to & from
           multiples of 256 bytes. They take in a key to create the padding. 
           This method is intended to also aid in protecting against padding
           oracle attacks.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.12.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  The OPAKE protocol was renamed to ROPAKE, an acronym for Ratcheting 
           Opaque Password Authenticated Key Exchange. This change was necessary 
           since OPAKE is already a name for an existing PAKE protocol. This change 
           also means the ``Opake`` class name was changed to ``Ropake``. 
        -  The ``Ropake`` class' registration algorithm was slightly modified to 
           use the generated Curve25519 ``shared_key`` an extra time in the key 
           derivation process. This shouldn't break any currently authenticated 
           sessions. 
        -  The ``asyncio_contextmanager`` package is no longer a listed dependency 
           in ``setup.py``. The main file from that package was copied over into the 
           ``/aiootp`` directory in order to remove the piece of code that caused 
           warnings to crop up when return values were retrieved from async 
           generators. This change will put an end to this whack-a-mole process of 
           trying to stop the warnings with try blocks scattered about the codebase. 
        -  Added ``asave_tag``, ``save_tag``, ``asave_file`` & ``save_file`` methods 
           to the database classes so that specific entries can be saved to disk 
           without having to save the entire database which is much more costly. The 
           manifest file isn't saved to disk when these methods are used, so if a 
           tag file isn't already saved in the database, then the saved files will 
           not be present in the manifest or in the cache upon subsequent loads of 
           the database. The saved file will still however be saved on the 
           filesystem, though unbeknownst to the database instance.
        -  The ``Namespace`` class now redacts all obvious key material in instance 
           repr's, which is any 64+ hex character string, or any number with 64+ 
           decimal digits. 
        -  Removed the experimental recursive value retrieval within ``Comprende``'s 
           ``__aexamine_sent_exceptions`` & ``__examine_sent_exceptions`` methods. 
           This change leads to more reliable & faster code, in exchange for an 
           unnecessary feature being removed. 
        -  Bug fix of the ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` methods by editing the code in 
           the ``asyncio_contextmanager`` dependency & using the patched package 
           instead of the ``comprehension`` decorator for the ``arelay`` & ``relay`` 
           methods of ``Comprende``. Their internal algorithms was also updated to 
           be simpler, but are incompatible with the outputs of past versions of 
           these methods. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & documentation additions / modifications throughout 
           the library. 
        -  Various small bug fixes.
        -  The shared keys derived from the ``Ropake`` protocol are now returned in 
           a ``Namespace`` object instead of a raw dictionary, which allows the 
           values to be retrieved by dotted &/or bracketed lookup. 
        -  The ``atest_hmac`` & ``test_hmac`` algorithms / methods were made more 
           efficient & were refactored. Now they call ``atime_safe_equality`` &
           ``time_safe_equality`` internally, which are new methods that can apply
           the non-constant time but randomized timing comparisons on any pairs of
           values.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.11.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  The Opake protocol was made greatly more efficient. This was done by 
           replacing the diffie-hellman verifiers with a hash & xor commit & reveal
           system. Most hashing was made more efficient my using quicker & smaller
           ``sha_512`` function instead of ``nc_512``, & streamlining the protocol.
        -  The ``Opake.client`` & ``Opake.client_registration`` methods now take
           an instantiated client database instead of client credentials which 
           improves security, efficiency & usability. This change reduces the amount
           of exposure received by user passwords & other credentials. It also 
           simplifies usage of the protocol by only needing to carry around a 
           database instead of a slew of credentials, which is also faster, since
           the credentials are passed through the cpu & memory hard ``passcrypt``
           function everytime to open the database.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Heavy refactorings & documentation additions / modifications of the 
           ``Opake`` class. Removed the ``Opake.ainit_database`` & ``Opake.init_database``
           methods, & made the ``salt`` default argument parameter in 
           ``Opake.aclient_database``, ``Opake.client_database``, ``Opake.adb_login`` &
           ``Opake.db_login`` into a keyword only argument so any extra user defined
           ``credentials`` are able to be passed without specifying a salt.
        -  The decorators for the ``Comprende.arelay`` & ``Comprende.relay`` methods 
           were changed from ``@asyncio_contextmanager.async_contextmanager`` to
           ``@comprehension()`` to stop that package from raising exceptions when
           we retrieve return values from async generators.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.10.1 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` classes to ``asynchs.py`` which abstract 
           spawning & getting return values from async & sync functions intended to 
           be run in threads, processes or pools of the former types. This simplifies 
           & adds time control to usages of processes & threads throughout the 
           library. 
        -  Reduced the effectiveness of timing analysis of the modular exponentiation 
           in the ``Opake`` class' verifiers by making the process return values 
           only after discrete intervals of time. Timing attacks on that part of the 
           protocol may still be viable, but should be significantly reduced. 
        -  Bug fix in ``Comprende`` which should take care of warnings raised from 
           the ``aiocontext`` package when retrieving async generator values by 
           raising ``UserWarning`` within them. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Heavy refactorings of the ``Opake`` class. 
        -  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
        -  Further add ``return_exceptions=True`` flag to gather calls in ``ciphers.py``. 
        -  Added ``is_registration`` & ``is_authentication`` which take a client 
           hello message that begin the ``Opake`` protocol, & return ``False`` if 
           the message is not either a registration or authentication message, 
           respectively, & return ``"Maybe"`` otherwise, since these functions can't 
           determine without running the protocol whether or not the message is 
           valid. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.10.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added a new oblivious, one-message, password authenticated key exchange 
           protocol class in ``aiootp.ciphers.Opake``. It is a first attempt at the 
           protocol, which works rather well, but may be changed or cleaned up in a 
           future update. 
        -  Added the ``cryptography`` package as a dependency for elliptic curve 
           25519 diffie-hellman key exchange in the ``Opake`` protocol. 
        -  Fix buggy data processing functions in ``generics.py`` module. 
        -  Added ``silent`` flag to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` methods, which 
           allows their instances to finish initializing even if a file is missing 
           from the filesystem, normally causing a ``FileNotFoundError``. This makes 
           trouble-shooting corrupted databases easier. 
        -  Added new ``aiootp.paths.SecurePath`` function which returns the path to 
           a unique directory within the database's default directory. The name of 
           the returned directory is a cryptographic value used to create & open the 
           default database used by the ``Opake`` class to store the cryptographic 
           salt that secures the class' client passwords. It's highly recommended 
           to override this default database by instantiating the Opake class with 
           a custom user-defined key. The instance doesn't need to be saved, since 
           all the class' methods are either class or static methods. The ``__init__`` 
           method only changes the class' default database to one opened with the 
           user-defined ``key`` &/or ``directory`` kwargs, & should really only be 
           done once at the beginning of an application. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
        -  Added ``Comprende`` class feature to return the values from even the 
           generators within an instance's arguments. This change better returns 
           values to the caller from chains of ``Comprende`` generators. 
        -  Fixed ``commons.BYTES_TABLE`` missing values. 
        -  Added ``commons.DH_PRIME_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` & ``commons.DH_GENERATOR_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` 
           constants for use in the ``Opake`` protocol's public key verifiers. 
        -  Added other values to the ``commons.py`` module. 
        -  Added new very large no-collision hash functions to the ``generics.py`` 
           module used to xor with diffie-hellman public keys in the ``Opake`` class. 
        -  Added new ``wait_on`` & ``await_on`` ``Comprende`` generators to ``generics.py`` 
           which waits for a queue or container to be populated & yields it whenever 
           it isn't empty. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.3 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Speed & efficiency improvements in the ``Comprende`` class & ``azip``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & code cleanups.
        -  Added ``apop`` & ``pop`` ``Comprende`` generators to the library.
        -  Switched the default character table in the ``ato_base``, ``to_base``, 
           ``afrom_base``, & ``from_base`` chainable generator methods from the 62
           character ``ASCII_ALPHANUMERIC`` table, to the 95 character ``ASCII_TABLE``.
        -  Made the digits generators in ``randoms.py`` automatically create a new
           cryptographically secure key if a key isn't passed by a user.
        -  Some extra data processing functions added to ``generics.py``.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.2 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` instance methods to ``OneTimePad``,
           ``Keys``, & ``AsyncKeys`` classes. They produce password hashes that are
           not just secured by the salt & passcrypt algorithm settings, but also by
           their main symmetric instance keys. This makes passwords infeasible to
           crack without also compromising the instance's 512-bit key.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Further improvements to the random number generator in ``randoms.py``.
           Made its internals less sequential thereby raising the bar of work needed
           by an attacker to successfully carry out an order prediction attack.
        -  Added checks in the ``Passcrypt`` class to make sure both a salt & 
           password were passed into the algorithm.
        -  Switched ``PermissionError`` exceptions in ``Passcrypt._validate_args``
           to ``ValueError`` to be more consistent with the rest of the class.
        -  Documentation updates / fixes.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.1 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Now any falsey values for the ``salt`` keyword argument in the library's 
           ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, & 
           ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators, & other functions around the 
           library, will cause them to generate a new cryptographically secure 
           pseudo-random value for the salt. It formerly only did this when ``salt`` 
           was ``None``. 
        -  The ``seeder`` & ``aseeder`` generators have been updated to introduce 
           512 new bits of entropy from ``secrets.token_bytes`` on every iteration 
           to ensure that the CSPRNG will produce secure outputs even if its 
           internal state is somehow discovered. This also allows for simply calling 
           the CSPRNG is enough, there's no longer a strong reason to pass new 
           entropy into it manually, except to add even more entropy as desired.
        -  Made ``size`` the last keywordCHECKSUMS.txt argument in ``encrypt`` & 
           ``aencrypt`` to better mirror the signatures for rest of the library. 
        -  Added ``token_bits`` & ``atoken_bits`` functions to ``randoms.py`` which 
           are renamings of ``secrets.randbits``. 
        -  Refactored & improved the security og ``randoms.py``'s random number 
           generator. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.0 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added hmac codes to ciphertext for the following functions: ``json_encrypt``, 
           ``ajson_encrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_encrypt``, 
           ``Database.encrypt`` & ``AsyncDatabase.aencrypt``. This change greatly 
           increases the security of ciphertext by ensuring it hasn't been modified 
           or tampered with maliciously. One-time pad ciphertext is maleable, so 
           without hmac validation it can be changed to successfully allow 
           decryption but return the wrong plaintext. These functions are the 
           highest level abstractions of the library for encryption/decryption, 
           which made them excellent targets for this important security update. 
           As well, it isn't easily possible for the library to provide hmac codes 
           for generators that produce ciphertext, because the end of a stream of 
           ciphertext isn't known until after the results have left the scope 
           of library code. So users will need to produce their own hmac codes for 
           generator ciphertext unless we find an elegant solution to this issue. 
           These functions now all return dictionaries with the associated hmac 
           stored in the ``"hmac"`` entry. The bytes functions formerly returned 
           lists, now their ciphertext is available from the ``"ciphertext"`` entry. 
           And, all database files will have an hmac attached to them now. These 
           changes were designed to still be compatible with old ciphertexts but 
           they'll likely be made incompatible by the v0.11.x major release. 
        -  Only truthy values are now valid ``key`` keyword arguments in the 
           library's ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, 
           & ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators. Also now seeding extra entropy 
           into ``csprng`` & ``acsprng`` when ``salt`` is falsey within them. 
        -  Only truthy values are now valid for ``password`` & ``salt`` arguments in 
           ``apasscrypt``, ``passcrypt`` & their variants. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Updates to documentation & ``README.rst`` tutorials.
        -  The ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments in ``sum_passcrypt`` &
           ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods were switched to keyword
           only arguments.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.8.1 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``sum_passcrypt`` & ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods 
           to ``Comprende`` class. They cumulatively apply the passcrypt algorithm 
           to each yielded value from an underlying generator with the passcrypt'd 
           prior yielded result used as a salt. This allows making proofs of work, 
           memory & space-time out of iterations of the passcrypt algorithm very 
           simple. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed. 
        -  Various refactorings of the codebase. 
        -  Made ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments into keyword only arguments 
           in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes. 
        -  The ``length`` keyword argument in functions around the library was 
           changed to ``size`` to be consistent across the whole package. Reducing 
           the cognitive burden of memorizing more than one name for the same concept. 
        -  Various efficiency boosts. 
        -  Edits to ``README.rst``. 
        -  Added ``encode_salt``, ``aencode_salt``, ``decode_salt`` & ``adecode_salt`` 
           functions to the library, which gives access to the procedure used to 
           encrypt & decrypt the random salt which is often the first element 
           produced in one-time pad ciphertexts. 
        -  Added cryptographically secure pseudo-random values as default keys in 
           encryption functions to safeguard against users accidentally encrypting 
           data without specifying a key. This way, such mistakes will produce 
           ciphertext with an unrecoverable key, instead of without a key at all. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.8.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix ``test_hmac``, ``atest_hmac`` functions in the keys & database 
           classes. The new non-constant-time algorithm needs a random salt to be 
           added before doing the secondary hmac to prevent some potential exotic 
           forms of chosen plaintext/ciphertext attacks on the algorithm. The last 
           version of the algorithm should not be used. 
        -  The ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` interfaces were overhauled to remove the 
           persistance of instance salts. They were intended to be updated by users 
           with the ``reset`` & ``areset`` methods, but that cannot be guaranteed 
           easily through the class, so it is an inappropriate interface since 
           reusing salts for encryption is completely insecure. The instances do
           still maintain state of their main encryption key, & new stateful methods
           for key generation, like ``mnemonic`` & ``table_key``, have been added.
           The ``state`` & ``astate`` methods have been removed.
        -  Gave ``OneTimePad`` instances new stateful methods from the ``ciphers.py`` 
           module & ``keygens.py`` keys classes. Its instances now remember the main 
           symmetric key behind the ``key`` property & automatically passes it as a 
           keyword argument to the methods in ``OneTimePad.instance_methods``.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Update ``CHANGES.rst`` file with the updates that were not logged for
           v0.7.1.
        -  ``BYTES_TABLE`` was turned into a list so that the byte characters can 
           be retrieved instead of their ordinal numbers.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.7.1
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix a mistake in the signatures of ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt. The args
           ``kb``, ``cpu`` & ``hardness`` were changed into keyword only arguments
           to mitigate user mistakes, but the internal calls to those functions were
           still using positional function calls, which broke the api. This issue
           is now fixed.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.7.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Replaced usage of bare ``random`` module functions, to usage of an 
           instance of ``random.Random`` to keep from messing with user's settings 
           on that module. 
        -  Finalized the algorithm for the ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions. 
           The algorithm is now provably memory & cpu hard with a wide security 
           margin with adequate settings. The algorithm isn't likely change with 
           upcoming versions unless a major flaw is found. 
        -  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` 
           is now ``3`` & now directly determines how many hash iterations are done 
           for each element in the memory cache. This provides much more 
           responsiveness to users & increases the capacity to impact resource cost
           with less tinkering. 
        -  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
           scheme which is not constant time, but which instead does not leak useful 
           information. It does this by not comparing the hmacs of the data, but of 
           a pair of secondary hmacs. The timing analysis itself is now dependant 
           on knowledge of the key, since any conclusions of such an analysis would 
           be unable correlate its findings with any supplied hmac without it. 
        -  Added  ``test_hmac`` & ``atest_hmac`` to the database classes, & changed 
           their hmac algorithm from ``sha3_512`` to ``sha3_256``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate function signatures.
        -  Added ``mnemonic`` & ``amnemonic`` key generators to ``keygens.py`` with
           a wordlist 2048 entries long. A custom wordlist can also be passed in.
        -  Minor changes in ``Comprende`` to track down a bug in the functions that 
           use the asyncio_contextmanager package. It causes a warning when asking
           async generators to return (not yield) values.
        -  Some refactoring of ``random_number_generator`` & ``arandom_number_generator``.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.6.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Replaced the usage of ``os.urandom`` within the package with 
           ``secrets.token_bytes`` to be more reliable across platforms. 
        -  Replaced several usages of ``random.randrange`` within ``randoms.py`` to 
           calls to ``secrets.token_bytes`` which is faster & more secure. It
           now also seeds ``random`` module periodically prior to usage.
        -  Changed the internal cache sorting algorithm of ``passcrypt`` & 
           ``apasscrypt`` functions. The key function passed to ``list.sort(key=key)`` 
           now not only updates the ``hashlib.sha3_512`` proof object with 
           each element in the cache, but with it's own current output. This change 
           is incompatible with previous versions of the functions. The key function 
           is also trimmed down of unnecessary value checking. 
        -  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``
           is now ``40_000``. This is right at the edge of when the argument begins
           impacting the cpu work needed to comptute the password hash when the ``kb``
           argument is the default of ``1024``.
        -  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
           constant time algorithm.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
        -  Added a ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`` instance to the ``asynchs``
           module for easily spinning off threads. It's available under 
           ``asynchs.thread_pool``.
        -  Added ``sort`` & ``asort`` chainable generator method to the ``Comprende`` 
           class. They support sorting by a ``key`` sorting function as well.
        -  Changed the name of ``asynchs.executor_wrapper`` to ``asynchs.wrap_in_executor``.
        -  Changed the name of ``randoms.non0_digit_stream``, ``randoms.anon0_digit_stream``,
           ``randoms.digit_stream`` & ``randoms.adigit_stream`` to ``randoms.non_0_digits``,
           ``randoms.anon_0_digits``, ``randoms.digits`` & ``randoms.adigits``.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
        -  ``apasscrypt`` & ``Passcrypt.anew`` now use the synchronous version of the 
           algorithm internally because it's faster & it doesn't change the 
           parallelization properties of the function since it's already run 
           automatically in another process.
        -  Added ``shuffle``, ``ashuffle``, ``unshuffle``, & ``aunshuffle`` functions
           to ``randoms.py`` that reorder sequences pseudo-randomly based on their
           ``key`` & ``salt`` keyword arguments.
        -  Fixed bugs in ``AsyncKeys`` & ``debuggers.py``.
        -  Added ``debugger`` & ``adebugger`` chainable generator methods to the
           ``Comprende`` class which benchmarks & inspects running generators with
           an inline syntax.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.5.1
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed a bug in the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` of the database classes 
           that assigned to a variable within a closure that was nonlocal but which 
           wasn't declared non-local. This caused an error which made the methods 
           unusable. 
        -  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions which are designed to be 
           tunably memory & cpu hard password-based key derivation function. It was 
           inspired by the scrypt protocol but internally uses the library's tools. 
           It is a first attempt at the protocol, it's internal details will likely 
           change in future updates. 
        -  Added ``bytes_keys`` & ``abytes_keys`` generators, which are just like 
           the library's ``keys`` generator, except they yield the concatenated 
           ``sha3_512.digest`` instead of the ``sha3_512.hexdigest``. 
        -  Added new chainable generator methods to the ``Comprende`` class for 
           processing bytes, integers, & hex strings into one another. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups.
        -  New tests added to the test suite for ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``.
        -  The ``Comprende`` class' ``alist`` & ``list`` methods can now be passed
           a boolean argument to return either a ``mutable`` list directly from the 
           lru_cache, or a copy of the cached list. This list is used by the 
           generator itself to yield its values, so wilely magic can be done on the
           list to mutate the underlying generator's results. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.5.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Added interfaces in ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` to handle encrypting
           & decrypting streams (``Comprende`` generators) instead of just raw json 
           data. They're methods called ``encrypt_stream``, ``decrypt_stream``,
           ``aencrypt_stream``, & ``adecrypt_stream``.
        -  Changed the attribute ``_METATAG`` used by ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` 
           to name the metatags entry in the database. This name is smaller, cleaner 
           & is used to prevent naming collisions between user entered values & the 
           metadata the classes need to organize themselves internally. This change 
           will break databases from older versions keeping them from accessing their 
           metatag child databases.
        -  Added the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database``
           which return coroutines that accept potentially sensitive identifiers &
           turns them into salted ``size`` length hashes distinguished by a ``salt``
           & a ``category``.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code & logic cleanups / speedups.
        -  Refactorings of the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` classes.
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.4.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed bug in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt`` function which inaccurately called
           a synchronous ``Comprende`` end-point method on the underlying async
           generator, causing an exception and failure to function.
        -  Changed the procedures in ``akeys`` & ``keys`` that generate their internal
           key derivation functions. They're now slightly faster to initialize &
           more theoretically secure since each internal state is fed by a seed
           which isn't returned to the user. This encryption algorithm change is 
           incompatible with the encryption algorithms of past versions.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups.
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.
        -  Keyword arguments in ``Keys().test_hmac`` & ``AsyncKeys().atest_hmac``
           had their order switched to be slightly more friendly to use.
        -  Added documentation to ``README.rst`` on the inner workings of the
           one-time-pad algorithm's implementation.
        -  Made ``Compende.arandom_sleep`` & ``Compende.random_sleep`` chainable
           generator methods.
        -  Changed the ``Compende.adelimit_resize`` & ``Compende.delimit_resize``
           algorithms to not yield inbetween two joined delimiters in a sequence
           being resized.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.3.1
        =========================
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed bug where a static method in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` was 
           wrongly labelled a class method causing a failure to initialize.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.3.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  The ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now use the more secure ``afilename`` 
           & ``filename`` methods to derive the hashmap name and encryption streams
           from a user-defined tag internal to their ``aencrypt`` / ``adecrypt`` / 
           ``encrypt`` / ``decrypt`` methods, as well as, prior to them getting called. 
           This will break past versions of databases' ability to open their files.
        -  The package now has built-in functions for using the one-time-pad 
           algorithm to encrypt & decrypt binary data instead of just strings
           or integers. They are available in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt``, 
           ``aiootp.abytes_decrypt``, ``aiootp.bytes_encrypt`` & ``aiootp.bytes_decrypt``.
        -  The ``Comprende`` class now has generators that do encryption & decryption 
           of binary data as well. They are available from any ``Comprende`` generator
           by the ``abytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_decrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt`` & ``bytes_decrypt`` 
           chainable method calls.
           
           
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed typos and inaccuracies in various docstrings.
        -  Added a ``__ui_coordination.py`` module to handle inserting functionality 
           from higher-level to lower-level modules and classes.
        -  Various code clean ups and redundancy eliminations.
        -  ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes now only update their ``self.salt`` key
           by default when their ``areset`` & ``reset`` methods are called. This
           aligns more closely with their intended use.
        -  Added ``arandom_sleep`` & ``random_sleep`` chainable methods to the
           ``Comprende`` class which yields outputs of generators after a random 
           sleep for each iteration.
        -  Added several other chainable methods to the ``Comprende`` class for
           string & bytes data processing. They're viewable in ``Comprende.lazy_generators``.
        -  Added new, initial tests to the test suite.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.2.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Added ephemeral salts to the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` file 
           encryption procedures. This is a major security fix, as re-encryption 
           of files with the same tag in a database with the same open key would 
           use the same streams of key material each time, breaking encryption if 
           two different versions of a tag file's ciphertext stored to disk were 
           available to an adversary. The database methods ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``, 
           ``aencrypt`` & ``adecrypt`` will now produce and decipher true one-time 
           pad ciphertext with these ephemeral salts. 
        -  The ``aiootp.subkeys`` & ``aiootp.asubkeys`` generators were revamped 
           to use the ``keys`` & ``akeys`` generators internally instead of using 
           their own, slower algorithm. 
        -  ``AsyncDatabase`` file deletion is now asynchronous by running the 
           ``builtins.os.remove`` function in an async thread executor. The 
           decorator which does the magic is available at ``aiootp.asynchs.executor_wrapper``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix typos in ``__root_salt`` & ``__aroot_salt`` docstrings. Also replaced 
           the ``hash(self)`` argument for their ``lru_cache``  & ``alru_cache`` 
           with a secure hmac instead. 
        -  add ``gi_frame``, ``gi_running``, ``gi_code``, ``gi_yieldfrom``, 
           ``ag_frame``, ``ag_running``, ``ag_code`` & ``ag_await`` properties to 
           ``Comprende`` class to mirror async/sync generators more closely. 
        -  Remove ``ajson_encrypt``, ``ajson_decrypt``, ``json_encrypt``, 
           ``json_decrypt`` functions' internal creation of dicts to contain the 
           plaintext. It was unnecessary & therefore wasteful. 
        -  Fix docstrings in ``OneTimePad`` methods mentioning ``parent`` kwarg which 
           is a reference to deleted, refactored code. 
        -  Fix incorrect docstrings in databases ``namestream`` & ``anamestream`` 
           methods. 
        -  Added ``ASYNC_GEN_THROWN`` constant to ``Comprende`` class to try to stop 
           an infrequent & difficult to debug ``RuntimeError`` when async generators 
           do not stop after receiving an ``athrow``. 
        -  Database tags are now fully loaded when they're copied using the methods 
           ``into_namespace`` & ``ainto_namespace``. 
        -  Updated inaccurate docstrings in ``map_encrypt``, ``amap_encrypt``, 
           ``map_decrypt`` & ``amap_decrypt`` ``OneTimePad`` methods. 
        -  Added ``acustomize_parameters`` async function to ``aiootp.generics`` 
           module. 
        -  Various code clean ups.
