        aiootp - Asynchronous pseudo-one-time-pad based crypto and anonymity library.
        =============================================================================
        
        ``aiootp`` is an asynchronous library providing access to cryptographic 
        primatives and abstractions, transparently encrypted / decrypted file 
        I/O and databases, as well as powerful, pythonic utilities that 
        simplify data processing & cryptographic procedures in python code. 
        This library's online MRAE / AEAD cipher, called ``Chunky2048``, is an 
        implementation of the **pseudo-one-time-pad**. The aim is to create a simple, 
        standard, efficient implementation that's indistinguishable from the 
        unbreakable one-time-pad cipher; to give users and applications access to 
        user-friendly cryptographic tools; and, to increase the overall security, 
        privacy, and anonymity on the web, and in the digital world. Users will 
        find ``aiootp`` to be easy to write, easy to read, and fun. 
        
        
        
        
        Important Disclaimer
        --------------------

        _`Transparently Encrypted Databases`
        ------------------------------------
        
        The package's ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes are very powerful data persistence utilities. They automatically handle encryption & decryption of user data & metadata, providing a pythonic interface for storing & retrieving any json serializable objects. They're designed to seamlessly bring encrypted bytes at rest to users as dynamic objects in use.
        
        
        _`Ideal Initialization`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Make a new user key with a fast, cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. Then this strong 512-bit key can be used to create a database object.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from aiootp import AsyncKeys, AsyncDatabase
            
            
            key = await AsyncKeys.acsprng()
        
            db = await AsyncDatabase(key)
            
        
        _`User Profiles`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        With User Profiles, passwords may be used instead to open a database. Often, passwords & passphrases contain very little entropy. So, they aren't recommended for that reason. However, profiles provide a succinct way to use passwords more safely. They do this by deriving strong keys from low entropy user input, the memory/cpu hard passcrypt algorithm, & a secret salt which is automatically generated & stored on the user's filesystem.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Convert any available user credentials into cryptographic tokens ->
        
            tokens = await AsyncDatabase.agenerate_profile_tokens(
            
                "server-url.com",     # An unlimited number of arguments can be passed
                
                "address@email.net",  # here as additional, optional credentials.
                
                username="username",
                
                password="password",
                
                salt="optional salt keyword argument",
                
            )
        
        
            # Finally, use those special tokens to open a database instance ->
        
            db = await AsyncDatabase.agenerate_profile(tokens)
        
        
        _`Tags`
        ^^^^^^^
        
        Data within databases are primarily organized by Tags. Tags are simply json serializable labels, and the data stored under them can also be any json serializable objects.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Open a context to automatically save data to disk when closed ->
        
            async with db:
            
                db["tag"] = {"data": "can be any json serializable object"}
                
                db["hobby"] = await db.abase64_encode(b"fash smasher")
                
                db["bitcoin"] = "0bb6eee10d2f8f45f8a"
                
                db["lawyer"] = {"#": "555-555-1000", "$": 13000.50}
                
                db["safehouses"] = ["Dublin Forgery", "NY Insurrection"]
        
        
            # Instead of saving the entire database when a single new tag is 
        
            # added, a tag can be saved to disk individually ->
        
            await db.asave_tag("lawyer")
        
        
            # View an instance's tags ->
        
            db.tags
            >>> ['tag', 'hobby', 'bitcoin', 'lawyer', 'safehouses']
        
        
            # Set & query tags in the instance's cache with dedicated method ->
        
            await db.aset("pseudonym", "Free The People")
        
            await db.aquery("pseudonym")
            >>> 'Free The People'
        
            assert "pseudonym" in db
        
        
            # Remove a tag from the cache & its associated data on the filesystem ->
        
            await db.apop("pseudonym")
            >>> 'Free The People'
        
            assert "pseudonym" not in db
        
        Access to data is open to the user, so care must be taken not to let external api calls touch the database without accounting for how that can go wrong.
        
        
        _`Metatags`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Metatags are used to organize & create children of parent databases. They are fully-fledged databases all on their own, with their own distinct key material too. They're accessible from the parent through an attribute that's added to the parent instance with the same name as the metatag. When the parent is saved, or deleted, then their children are also.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Create a metatag database ->
        
            molly = await db.ametatag("molly")
        
        
            # They can contain their own sets of tags (and metatags) ->
            
            molly["hobbies"] = ["skipping", "punching"]
            
            molly["hobbies"].append("reading")
        
        
            # The returned metatag & the reference in the parent are the same ->
        
            assert molly["hobbies"] is db.molly["hobbies"]
            
            assert isinstance(molly, AsyncDatabase)
            
        
            # All of an instance's metatags are quickly viewable ->
        
            db.metatags
            >>> ['molly']
            
        
            # Delete a metatag from an instance ->
        
            await db.adelete_metatag("molly")
            
            db.metatags
            >>> []
            
            assert not hasattr(db, "molly")
        
        
        _`Basic Management`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        There's a few settings & public methods on databases for users to manage their instances & data. This includes general utilities for saving & deleting databases to & from the filesystem, as well as fine-grained controls for how data is handled. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # The directory attribute is set within the instance's __init__
        
            # using a keyword-only argument. It's the directory where the
        
            # instance will store all of its files.
        
            db.directory
            >>> PosixPath('site-packages/aiootp/aiootp/databases')
            
            
            # Write database changes to disk with transparent encryption ->
            
            await db.asave()
        
        
            # Entering the instance's context also saves data to disk ->
        
            async with db:
            
                print("Saving to disk...")
            
        
            # Delete a database from the filesystem ->
            
            await db.adelete_database()
            
            
        As databases grow in the number of tags, metatags & the size of data within, it may become desireable to load data from them as needed, instead of all at once during initialization. This can be done with the ``preload`` boolean keyword argument.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Let's create some test values to show the impact preloading has ->
        
            async with (await AsyncDatabase(key)) as db:
        
                db["favorite_foods"] = ["justice", "community"]
            
                await db.ametatag("exercise_routines") 
            
        
            # This is how to toggle preloading off during initialization ->
        
            quick_db = await AsyncDatabase(key, preload=False)
            
            
            # Now to retrieve elements from an async database, the ``aquery`` 
        
            # method must first be used to load a tag into the cache ->
        
            async with quick_db:
            
                quick_db["favorite_foods"]
                >>> None
            
                loaded_value = await quick_db.aquery("favorite_foods")
            
                assert loaded_value == ["justice", "community"]
            
                assert quick_db["favorite_foods"] == ["justice", "community"]
            
            
                # Metatags need to be loaded manually as well ->
            
                quick_db.exercise_routines
                >>> AttributeError:
            
                await quick_db.ametatag("exercise_routines")
            
                assert type(quick_db.exercise_routines) == AsyncDatabase
        
        
        _`Mirrors`
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Database mirrors allow users to make copies of all files within a database under new encryption keys. This is useful if users simply want to make backups, or if they'd like to update / change their database keys. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # A unique login key / credentials are needed to create a new 
        
            # database ->
            
            new_key = await AsyncKeys.acsprng()
            
            new_db = await AsyncDatabase(new_key)
        
        
            # Mirroring an existing database is done like this ->
            
            await new_db.amirror_database(db)
        
            assert new_db["favorite_foods"] is db["favorite_foods"]
        
        
            # If the user is just updating their database keys, then the old
        
            # database should be deleted ->
        
            await db.adelete_database()
        
        
            # Now the new database can be saved to disk & given an appropriate 
        
            # name ->
        
            async with new_db as db:
        
                pass
        
        
        _`Namespaces`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Database Tags can be loaded into ``Namespace`` objects. This saves lots of time & cpu effort on lookups. This is because databases use cryptographic hashes of Tags to find their associtated data within themselves. This can be up to a couple thousand times slower than the dotted lookups on a ``Namespace`` object. This is a great way to load lots of encrypted values but then use them very efficiently in calculations.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Loading a database's tags into a Namespace is done this way ->
        
            namespace = await db.ainto_namespace()
            
            assert namespace.favorite_foods is db["favorite_foods"]
        
        
            # View all the Namespace's tags ->
        
            list(namespace.keys())
            >>> ["favorite_foods"]
        
        
            # View all the Namespace's values ->
        
            list(namespace.values())
            >>> [["justice", "community"]]
        
        
            # Namespace's yield their key & value pairs whien iterated over ->
        
            for tag, value in namespace:
            
                print(tag, value)
                
            >>> "favorite_foods" ["justice", "community"]
        
        
        _`Public Cryptographic Functions`
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Although databases handle encryption & decryption automatically, users may want to utilize their databases' keys to do custom cryptographic procedures manually. There are a few public functions available to users if they should want such functionality.
        
        
        _`Encrypt / Decrypt`

        _`HMACs`

        _`UUIDs`
        ********
        
        Instances can create special generator coroutines that are used to hash sensitive tags, or other data, into hexidecimal UUIDs of arbitrary size. These hashes are secured with the database instance's keys, & a salt value which is either passed in manually by the user, or if not, is automatically generated. The salt is available at the end of the coroutine's usage by calling for it to be returned & for the coroutine to be exited.

        _`Passcrypt`
        ************
        
        ``Passcrypt`` is the package's Argon2id-like password-based key derivation function. It was designed to be resistant to time-memory tradeoffs & cache timing side-channel attacks. When passwords (or data in general) are processed through an instance's passcrypt method, then they're also protected by being hashed together with the database's keys.

        FAQ
        ---
        
        **Q: What is the one-time-pad?**
        
        A: It's a provably unbreakable cipher. It's typically thought to be too cumbersome a cipher because it has strict requirements. Key size is one requirement, since keys must be at least as large as the plaintext in order to ensure this unbreakability. We've simplified this requirement in an attempt to create a pseudo-one-time-pad that's indistinguishable from a one-time-pad using a forward secret and semi-future secret key ratchet algorithm, with ephemeral salts for each stream, allowing users to securely produce endless streams of key material as needed from a single finite size 512-bit long-term key. This algorithmic approach lends itself to great optimizations, since hash processing hardware/sorftware is continually pushed to the edges of efficiency.
        
        
        **Q: Isn't this technically a stream cipher?** 
        
        A: For sure, one-time pads are stream ciphers. Though, if we trust that pseudo-random functions **(PRFs)** exist, then by definition, their outputs are indistinguishable from truly random bits. Because of this, it's proven that pseudo_-one-time-pads are computationally secure if they use secure PRFs. We conjecture that the sha3 hash functions are either PRFs, or are close with negligible difference. In our view, they're ideal candidates for the role of mimicking PRFs because: 
         -  they utilize large >512-bit internal hidden states 
         -  their cryptographic permutations are of high quality 
         -  they're irreversible & non-simulatable without knowing thier internal states
         -  loss of information occurs as they process data & produce digests 
         -  they're standardized cryptographic hash functions designed with wide security margins 
        
        True random advocates should note that even something as complicated, & seemingly unpredictable, as quantum mechanical events_, can in theory be the result of rather simple_ & predictable processes. We in no way claim to be quantum physicists. It, however, seems fitting in a discussion on the existence of randomness, & when challenging the conventional notion that the natural world is quintessential randomness, when none of that is proven (or provable) mathematically. This problem is related to several impossibility proofs [1_][2_][3_].

        **Q: What do you mean the ``aiootp.keys`` generator produces forward & semi-future secure key material?**
        
        A: The infinite stream of key material produced by that generator has amazing properties. Under the hood it's a ``hashlib.sha3_512`` key ratchet algorithm. It's internal state consists of a seed hash, & three ``hashlib.sha3_512`` objects primed iteratively with the one prior and the seed hash's seed. The first object is updated with the seed hash, its prior output, and the entropy that may be sent into the generator as a coroutine. This first object's digest is then used to update the last two objects before yielding the last two's concatenated results. The seed to the seed hash is itself the hash of the input key material, a random salt, and a user-defined ID value which can safely differentiate streams with the same key material. This algorithm is forward secure because compromising a future key will not compromise past keys since these hashes are irreversibly constructed. It's also semi-future secure since having a past key doesn't allow you to compute future keys without also compromising the seed hash, and the first ratcheting ``hashlib`` object. Since those two states are never disclosed or used for encryption, the key material produced is future secure with respect to itself only. Full future-security would allow for the same property even if the seed & ratchet object's states were compromised. This feature can, however, be added to the algorithm since the generator itself can receive entropy externally from a user at any arbitrary point in its execution, say, after computing a shared diffie-hellman exchange key.
        
        
        **Q: Why make a new cipher when AES is strong enough?** 
        
        A: Although primatives like AES are strong enough for now, there's no guarantee that future hardware or algorithms won't be developed which break them. In fact, AES's theoretical bit-strength has dropped over the years because of new developments_. Many popular AES modes don't provide authenication, salt reuse/misuse resistance, post-quantum resistance, or beyond-birthday-bound security. And the most common authenticated AES mode (GCM) involves some complex maths & has large pits implementers can easily fall into. AES's efficiency is important, even though it falls short in defending against these vulnerabilities. We wanted to build a cipher which focuses on security & simplicity for developers, even at the cost of some efficiency. AES is still considered a secure cipher, but the **pseudo-one-time pad** isn't considered theoretically "strong enough". Instead, it's mathematically proven to be computationally secure if the keystream is produced from a large enough key & a secure pseudo-random function. Such a cryptographic guarantee is too profound not to develop further into an accessible standard. This cipher is an attempt to do just that.

        **Q: How fast is this implementation of the pseudo one-time pad cipher?** 
        
        A: Well, because it relies on ``hashlib.sha3_512`` hashing to build key material streams, it's rather efficient. It can process about 20 MB/s on a ~1.5 GHz core for both encrypting & decrypting. This is slower than other stream ciphers, but this package is written in pure Python & without hardware optimizations. Using sha3_512 ASICs, or specific chipset instructions, or a lower-level language implementation, could make this algorithm competitively fast.
        
        
        **Q: What size keys does this pseudo one-time pad cipher use?** 
        
        A: It's been designed to work with 512-bit hexidecimal keys. 
        
        
        **Q: What's up with the ``AsyncDatabase`` / ``Database``?**
        
        A: The idea is to create an intuitive, pythonic interface to a transparently encrypted and decrypted persistence tool that also cryptographically obscures metadata. It's designed to work with json serializable data, which gives it native support for some basic python datatypes. It needs improvement with regard to disk memory efficiency. So, it's still a work in progress, albeit a very nifty one.
        
        
        **Q: Why are the modules transformed into ``Namespace`` objects?**
        
        A: We overwrite our modules in this package to have a more fine-grained control over what part of the package's internal state is exposed to users and applications. The goal is make it more difficult for users to inadvertently jeopardize their security tools, and minimize the attack surface available to adversaries. The ``aiootp.Namespace`` class also makes it easier to coordinate and decide the library's UI/UX across the package.
        
        
        
        ``Known Issues``
        ================
        
        -  The test suite for this software is under construction, & what tests
           have been published are currently inadequate to the needs of
           cryptography software.
        -  None of the hash functions in the public facing part of the library
           are to spec. This is because all inputs to the hash functions from
           the generics.py module are put into a tuple & stringified before
           hashing for user-friendliness, speed, readibility & the power of 
           being to hash any python object that has a repr. This behaviour is 
           purposeful, but can still be an issue.
        -  This package is currently in beta testing & active development.

        ``Changelog``
        =============
        
        
        Changes for version 0.19.4 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Created a private ``EntropyDaemon`` class to run a thread in the 
           background which feeds into & extracts entropy from some of the 
           package's entropy pools. Also moved the separate private ``_cache`` 
           entropy pools from the parameters to the random number generators. 
           They're now a single private ``_pool`` shared global that's 
           asynchronously & continuously updated by the background daemon thread. 
        -  Switched the ``random`` portion of function names in the ``randoms.py`` 
           module to read ``unique`` instead. This was done to the functions which 
           are actually pseudo-random. This should give users a better idea of 
           which functions do what. The exception is that the ``random_sleep`` & 
           ``arandom_sleep`` functions have kept their names even though they 
           sleep a pseudo-randomly variable amount of time. Their names may 
           cause more confusion if they were either ``(a)unique_sleep`` or 
           ``(a)urandom_sleep``. Because they don't use ``os.urandom`` & what 
           is a ``unique_sleep``? When / if a better name is found these 
           function names will be updated as well. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various docstring / documentation fixes & refactorings.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.19.3 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Removed ``ascii_encipher``, ``ascii_decipher``, ``aascii_encipher`` &
           ``aascii_decipher`` generators from the ``Chunky2048`` & ``Comprende``
           classes, & the package. It was unnecessary, didn't fit well with the
           intended use of the ``Padding`` class, & users would be much better
           served by converting their ascii to bytes to use the ``bytes_``
           generators instead.
        -  Removed the ``map_encipher``, ``map_decipher``, ``amap_encipher`` &
           ``amap_decipher`` generators from the ``Chunky2048`` & ``Comprende``
           classes, & the package. They were not being used internally to the 
           package anymore, & their functionality, security & efficiency could 
           not be guaranteed to track well with the changes in the rest of the 
           library.
        -  Added domain specificity to the ``X25519`` protocols' key derivations.
        -  Renamed the database classes' ``(a)encrypt`` & ``(a)decrypt`` methods
           to ``(a)json_encrypt`` & ``(a)json_decrypt`` for clarity & consistency
           with the rest of the package. Their signatures, as well as those in 
           ``(a)bytes_encrypt`` & ``(a)bytes_decrypt``, were also altered to
           receive plaintext & ciphertext as their only positional arguments. 
           The ``filename`` argument is now a keyword-only argument with a default
           ``None`` value. This allows databases to be used more succinctly for
           manual encryption & decryption by making the filename tweak optional.
        -  The ``runs`` keyword argument for the functions in ``randoms.py`` was
           renamed to ``rounds``. It seems more clear that it is controlling the
           number of rounds are internally run within the ``(a)random_number_generator``
           functions when deriving new entropy. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Fixes to docstrings & tutorials. Rewrite & reorganization of the 
           ``PREADME.rst`` & ``README.rst``. More updates to the readme's are still
           on the way.
        -  Slight fix to the Passcrypt docstring's algorithm diagram.
        -  Moved the default passcrypt settings to variables in the ``Passcrypt``
           class.
        -  Added the ability to send passcrypt settings into the ``mnemonic`` &
           ``amnemonic`` coroutines, which call the algorithm internally but 
           previously could only use the default settings.
        -  Some code cleanups & refactorings.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.19.2 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Made the output lengths of the ``Padding`` class' generator functions 
           uniform. When the footer padding on a stream of plaintext needs to 
           exceed the 256-byte blocksize (i.e. when the last unpadded plaintext 
           block's length ``L`` is ``232 > L < 256``), then another full block of
           padding is produced. The generators now yield 256-byte blocks 
           consistently (except during depadding when the last block of plaintext
           may be smaller than the blocksize), instead of sometimes producing a
           final padded block which is 512 bytes.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.19.1 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Fixed a bug where database classes were evaluating as falsey when they
           didn't have any tags saved in them. They should be considered truthy 
           if they're instantiated & ready to store data, even if they're 
           currently empty & not saved to disk. This was reflected in their 
           ``__bool__`` methods. The bug caused empty metatags not to be loaded 
           when an instance loads, even when ``preload`` is toggled ``True``.
        -  Removed the coroutine-receiving logic from the ``Padding`` class'
           ``Comprende`` generators. Since they buffer data, the received values
           aren't ever going to coincide with the correct iteration & will be
           susceptible to bugs
        -  Fixed a bug in the ``Padding`` class' ``Comprende`` generators which 
           cut iteration short because not enough data was available from the 
           underlying generators upfront. Now, if used correctly to pad/depad 
           chunks of plaintext 256 bytes at a time, then they work as expected.
        -  The ``update``, ``aupdate``, ``update_key`` & ``aupdate_key`` methods
           in both the ``StreamHMAC`` & ``DomainKDF`` classes now return ``self``
           to allow inline updates.
        -  Added ``acsprng`` & ``csprng`` function pointers to the ``Chunky2048``
           class.
        -  Updates to docstrings which didn't get updated with info on the new 
           *synthetic IV* feature.
        -  Some other docstring fixes.
        -  Some small code cleanups & refactorings.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.19.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Upgrade: The package's cipher was changed to an online, 
           authenticated scheme with salt reuse / misuse resistance. This was 
           acheived through a few backwards incompatible techniques: 
           
           1. A synthetic IV (SIV) is calculated from the keyed-hash of the first 
              256-byte block of plaintext. The SIV is then used to seed the 
              keystream generator, & is used to update the validator object. This 
              ensures that if the first block is unique, then the whole ciphertext 
              will be unique.
           2. A 16-byte ephemeral & random SIV-key is also prepended to the 
              first block of plaintext during message padding. Since this value 
              is also hashed to derive the SIV, this key gives a strong 
              guarantee that a given message will produce a globally unique 
              ciphertext.
           3. An 8-byte timestamp is prepended to the first block of plaintext 
              during padding. Timestamps are inherently sequential, they can be 
              verified by a user within some bounds, & can also be used to 
              mitigate replay attacks. Since it's hashed to make the SIV, then 
              it helps make the entire ciphertext unique.
           4. After being updated with each block of ciphertext, the validator's 
              current state is again fed into the keystream generator as a new 
              rotating seed. This mitigation is limited to ensuring only that 
              every following block of ciphertext to a block which is unique
              will also be unique. More specifically this means that: **if** 
              *all* **other mitigations fail to be unique**, or are missing, then 
              the first block which is unique **will appear the same**, except 
              for the bits which have changed, **but, all following blocks will
              be randomized.** This limitation could be avoided with a linear
              expansion in the ciphertext size by generating an SIV for each
              block of plaintext. This linear expansion is prohibitive as a
              default setting, but the block level secrecy, even when all other 
              mitigations fail, is enticing. This option may be added in the 
              future as a type of padding mode on the plaintext.
           
           The SIV-key is by far the most important mitigation, as it isn't 
           feasibly forgeable by an adversary, & therefore also protects against
           attacks using encryption oracles. These changes can be found in the 
           ``SyntheticIV`` class, the (en/de)cipher & xor generators, & the 
           ``StreamHMAC`` class in the ``ciphers.py`` module. The padding 
           changes can also be found in the new ``Padding`` class in the ``generics.py`` 
           module. The SIV is attached in the clear with ciphertexts & was 
           designed to function with minimal user interaction. It needs only to 
           be passed into the ``StreamHMAC`` class during decryption -- during 
           encryption it's automatically generated & stored in the ``StreamHMAC`` 
           validator object's ``siv`` property attribute. 
        -  Security Patch: The internal ``sha3_512`` kdf's to the  ``akeys``, ``keys``, 
           ``abytes_keys`` & ``bytes_keys`` keystream generators are now updated
           with 72 bytes of (64 key material + 8 padding), instead of just 64 
           bytes of key material. 72 bytes is the *bitrate* of the ``sha3_512`` 
           object. This change causes the internal state of the object to be permuted 
           for each iteration update & before releasing a chunk of key material. 
           Frequency analysis of ciphertext bytes didn't smooth out to the 
           cumulative distribution expected for all large ciphertexts prior to 
           this change. But after the change the distribution does normalize as
           expected. This indicates that the key material streams were biased 
           away from random in a small but measurable way. Although, no 
           particular byte values seem to have been preferred by this bias, this 
           is a huge shortcoming with unknown potential impact on the strength 
           of the package's cipher. This update is strongly recommended & is 
           backwards incompatible. 
        -  This update gives a name to the package's pseudo-one-time-pad cipher 
           implementation. It's now called ``Chunky2048``! The ``OneTimePad`` 
           class' name was updated to ``Chunky2048`` to match the change.
        -  The ``PreemptiveHMACValidation`` class & its related logic in the
           ``StreamHMAC`` class was removed. The chaining of validator output
           into the keystream makes running the validator over the ciphertext 
           separately or prior to the decryption process very costly. It would 
           either mean recalculating the full hash of the ciphertext a second 
           time to reproduce the correct outputs during each block, or a large 
           linear memory increase to hold all of its digests to be fed in some 
           time after preemtive validation. It's much simpler to remove that 
           functionality & potentially replace it with something else that fits
           the user's applications better. For instance, the ``current_digest``
           & ``acurrent_digest`` methods can produce secure, 32-byte authentication
           tags at any arbitrary blocks throughout the cipher's runtime, which
           validate the cipehrtext up to that point. Or, the ``next_block_id`` 
           & ``anext_block_id`` methods, which are a more robust option because 
           each id they produce validates the next ciphertext block before 
           updating the internal state of the validator. This acts as an 
           automatic message ordering algorithm, & leaves the deciphering 
           party's state unharmed by dropped packets or manipulated ciphertext.
        -  The ``update_key`` & ``aupdate_key`` methods were also added to the
           ``StreamHMAC`` class. They allow the user to update the validators'
           internal key with new entropy or context information during its 
           runtime. 
        -  The ``Comprende`` class now takes a ``chained`` keyword-only argument
           which flags an instance as a chained generator. This flag allows 
           instances to communicate up & down their generator chain using the 
           shared ``Namespace`` object accessible by their ``messages`` attribute.
        -  The chainable ``Comprende`` generator functions had their internals
           altered to allow them to receive, & pass down their chain, values 
           sent from a user using the standard coroutine ``send`` & ``asend``
           method syntax.
        -  ``Comprende`` instances no longer automatically reset themselves every 
           time they enter their context managers or when they are iterated over.
           This makes their interface more closely immitate the behavior of 
           async/sync generator objects. To get them to reset, the ``areset`` or 
           ``reset`` methods must be used. The message chaining introduced in 
           this update allows chains of ``Comprende`` async/sync generators to 
           inform each other when the user instructs one of them to reset.
        -  The standard library's ``hmac`` module is now used internally to the
           ``generics.py`` module's ``sha_512_hmac``, ``sha_256_hmac``, ``asha_512_hmac`` 
           & ``asha_256_hmac`` functions. They still allow any type of data to be 
           hashed, but also now default to hashing ``bytes`` type objects as 
           they are given.
        -  The new ``Domains`` class, found in ``generics.py``, is now used to
           encode constants into deterministic pseudo-random 8-byte values for
           helping turn hash function outputs into domain-specific hashes. Its
           use was included throughout the library. This method has an added
           benefit with respect to this package's usage of SHA-3. That being, the
           *bitrate* for both ``sha3_512`` & ``sha3_256`` are ``(2 * 32 * k) + 8``
           bytes, where ``k = 1`` for ``sha3_512`` & ``k = 2`` for ``sha3_256``.
           This means that prepending an 8-byte domain string to their inputs
           also makes it more efficient to add some multiple of key material
           to make the input data precisely equal the *bitrate*. More info on
           domain-specific hashing can be found here_.
        
        .. _here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/241.pdf
        
        -  A new ``DomainsKDF`` class in ``cipehrs.py`` was added to create a
           more standard & secure method of key derivation to the library which 
           also incorporates domain separation. Its use was integrated thoughout 
           the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes to mitigate any further 
           vulnerabilities of their internal key-derivation functions. The 
           database classes now also use bytes-type keys internally, instead 
           of hex strings.
        -  The ``Passcrypt`` class now contains methods which create & validate
           passcrypt hashes which have their settings & salt attached to them.
           Instances can now also be created with persistent settings that are 
           automatically sent into instance methods.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Many fixes of docstrings, typos & tutorials. 
        -  Many refactorings: name changes, extracted classes / functions, 
           reorderings & moves. 
        -  Various code clean-ups, efficiency & usability improvements.
        -  Many constants used throughout the library were given names defined 
           in the ``commons.py`` module.
        -  Removed extraneous functions throughout the library.
        -  The asymmetric key generation & exchange functions/protocols were 
           moved from the ``ciphers.py`` module to ``keygens.py``.
        -  Add missing modules to the MANIFEST.rst file. 
        -  Added a ``UniformPrimes`` class to the ``__datasets`` module for efficient 
           access to primes that aren't either mostly 1 or 0 bits, as is the case for 
           the ``primes`` helper table. These primes are now used in the ``Hasher`` 
           class' ``amask_byte_order`` & ``mask_byte_order`` methods. 
        -  The ``time_safe_equality`` & ``atime_safe_equality`` methods are now 
           standalone functions available from the ``generics.py`` module.
        -  Added ``reset_pool`` to the ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` classes. Also
           fixed a missing piece of logic in their ``submit`` method.
        -  Added various conversion values & timing functions to the ``asynchs.py``
           module.
        -  The ``make_uuid`` & ``amake_uuid`` coroutines had their names changed to 
           ``make_uuids`` & ``amake_uuids``.
        -  Created a new ``Datastream`` class in ``generics.py`` to handle buffering
           & resizing iterable streams of data. It enables simplifying logic that 
           must happen some number of iterations before the end of a stream. It's 
           utilized in the ``Padding`` class' generator functions available as 
           chainable ``Comprende`` methods.
        -  The ``data`` & ``adata`` generators can now produce a precise number of
           ``size``-length ``blocks`` as specified by a user. This gets rid of the
           confusing usage of the old ``stop`` keyword-only argument, which stopped 
           a stream after *approximately* ``size`` number of elements.
        -  Improved the efficiency & safety of entropy production in the 
           ``randoms.py`` module.
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.18.1 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: Deprecated & replaced an internal kdf for saving 
           database tags due to a vulnerability. If an adversary can get a user 
           to reveal the value returned by the ``hmac`` method when fed the tag 
           file's filename & the salt used for that encrypted tag, then they 
           could deduce the decryption key for the tag. A version check was 
           added only for backwards compatibility & will be removed on the next 
           update. All databases should continue functioning as normal, though 
           all users are advised to **re-save their databases** after upgrading
           so the new kdf can be used. This will not overwrite the old files,
           so they'll need to be deleted manually.
        -  Replaced usage of the async ``switch`` coroutine with ``asyncio.sleep``
           because it was not allowing tasks to switch as it was designed to.
           Many improvements were made related to this change to make the
           package behave better in async contexts.
        -  Removed the private method in the database classes which held a 
           reference to the root salt. It's now held in a private attribute. 
           This change simplifies the code a bit & allows instances to be 
           pickleable.
        -  The ``atimeout`` & ``timeout`` chainable ``Comprende`` generator
           methods can now stop the generators' executions mid-iteration. They
           run them in separate async tasks or thread pools, respectively, to 
           acheive this.
        -  The ``await_on`` & ``wait_on`` generators now restart their timeout
           counters after every successful iteration that detected a new value
           in their ``queue``. The ``delay`` keyword argument was changed to 
           ``probe_frequency``, a keyword-only argument.
        -  Removed the package's dependency on the ``aioitertools`` package.
        -  Made the ``sympy`` package an optional import. If any of its
           functionalities are used by the user, the package is only then
           imported & this is done automatically.
        -  Various streamlining efforts were made to the imports & entropy
           initialization to reduce the package's import & startup time.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Fixes of various typos, docstrings & tutorials.
        -  Various cleanups, refactorings & efficiency improvements.
        -  Added new tests for detecting malformed or modified ciphertexts.
        -  Removed extraneous functions in ``generics.py``.
        -  Add a ``UNIFORM_PRIME_512`` value to ``__datasets.py`` for use in the 
           ``Hasher.mask_byte_order`` & ``Hasher.amask_byte_order`` methods.
           Those methods were also altered to produce more uniform looking 
           results. The returned masked values are now also 64 bytes by default.
        -  Added an ``automate_key_use`` keyword-only boolean argument to the init
           for the ``OneTimePad``, ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` classes. It can be toggled to
           stop the classes from overwriting class methods so they 
           automatically read the instance's key attribute. This optionally 
           speeds up instantiation by an order of magnitude at the cost of 
           convenience.
        -  Fixed ``asynchs.Threads`` class' wrongful use of a ``multiprocessing``
           ``Manager.list`` object instead of a regular list.
        -  Changed the ``_delay`` keyword-only argument in ``Processes`` & ``Threads``
           classes' methods to ``probe_freqeuncy`` so users can specify how often
           results will be checked for after firing off a process, thread, or
           associated pool submission.
        -  Now the ``asubmit`` & ``submit`` methods in ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` 
           can accept keyword arguments.
        -  Added ``agather`` & ``gather`` methods to the ``Threads`` & ``Processes``
           classes. They receive any number of functions, & ``args`` &/or ``kwargs`` to
           pass to those functions when submitting them to their associated 
           pools.
        -  Changed the ``runsum`` instance IDs from hex strings to bytes & cleaned 
           up the instance caching & cleaning logic.
        -  Altered & made private the ``asalted_multiply`` & ``salted_multiply``
           functions in the ``randoms.py`` module.
        -  Started a new event loop specific to the ``randoms.py`` module which
           should prevent the ``RuntimeError`` when ``random_number_generator``
           is called from within the user's running event loop.
        -  Added a ``ValueError`` check to the ``(a)cspr(b/n)g`` functions in 
           ``randoms.py``. This will allow simultaneously running tasks to 
           request entropy from the function by returning a result from a 
           newly instantiated generator object. 
        -  Added checks in the ``*_encipher`` & ``*_decipher`` generators to 
           help assure users correctly declare the mode for their StreamHMAC 
           validator instances. 
        -  Fixed the ``__len__`` function in the database classes to count the 
           number of tags in the database & exclude their internal maintenaince 
           files.
        -  The ``TimeoutError`` raised after decrypting a ciphertext with an 
           expired timestamp now contains the seconds it has exceeded the ``ttl``
           in a ``value`` attribute.
        -  The timestamp used to sign the package now displays the day of 
           signing instead of the second of signing.
        -  The ``(a)sum_sha_*`` & ``(a)sum_passcrypt`` generators were altered to
           reapply the supplied ``salt`` on every iteration. 
        -  Stabilized the usability of the ``stop`` keyword-only argument in the
           ``adata`` & ``data`` generators. It now directly decides the total
           number of elements in a ``sequence`` allowed to be yielded.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.18.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: Rewrote the HMAC-like creation & authentication 
           process for all of the package's ciphers. Now, the ``*_encipher``
           & ``*_decipher`` ``Comprende`` generators must be passed a validator
           object to hash the ciphertext as it's being created / decrypted.
           The ``StreamHMAC`` class was created for this purpose. It's initalized
           with the user's long-term key, the ephemeral salt & the pid value.
           The pid value can now effectively be used to validate additional data.
           These changes force the package's cipher to be used as an AEAD cipher.
        -  Security Patch: The package's ``*_hmac`` hash functions & the ``Comprende``
           class' hash generators were rewritten to prepend salts & keys to data
           prior to hashing instead of appending. This is better for several 
           important reasons, such as: reducing the amortizability of costs in
           trying to brute-force hashes, & more closely following the reasoning
           behind the HMAC spec even though sha3 has a different security profile. 
        -  Algorithm Patch: The ``akeys``, ``keys``, ``abytes_keys``, & ``bytes_keys``
           algorithms have been patched to differentiate each iteration's two
           sha3_512 hashes from one another in perpetuity. They contained a design
           flaw which would, if both sha3_512 objects landed upon the same 
           1600-bit internal state, then they would produce the same keystreams 
           from then on. This change in backwards incompatible. This flaw is 
           infeasible to exploit in practice, but since the package's hashes & 
           ciphertext validations were already channging this release, there was 
           no reason to not fix this flaw so that it's self-healing if they ever 
           do land on the same internal states.
        -  The ``Passcrypt`` class & its algorithm were made more efficient to
           better equalize the cost for users & adversaries & simplifies the
           algorithm. Any inefficiencies in an implementation would likely cause
           the adversary to be able to construct optimized implementations to 
           put users at an even greater disadvantage at protecting their inputs
           to the passcrypt algorithm. It used the ``sum_sha_256`` hash function 
           internally, & since it was also changing in a non-backwards 
           compatible way with this update, it was the best time to clean up
           the implementation.
        -  Updated the package's description & its docstrings that refer to 
           the package's cipher as an implementation of the one-time-pad. It's 
           not accurate since the package uses pseudo-random hash functions to 
           produce key material. Instead, the package's goal is to create a 
           pseudo-one-time-pad that's indistinguishable from a one-time-pad.
           The ``OneTimePad`` class will keep its name for succinctness. 
        -  New ``amake_token``, ``make_token``, ``aread_token`` & ``read_token``
           class & instance methods added to the ``OneTimePad`` class. These
           tokens are urlsafe base64 encoded, are encrypted, authenticated &
           contain timestamps that can enforce a time-to-live for each token.
        -  Non-backwards compatible changes to the database classes' filenames,
           encryption keys & HMACs. The ``*_hmac`` hash functions that the 
           databases rely on were changing with this update, so additionally the 
           filenames table used to encode the filenames was switched from the 
           ``BASE_36_TABLE`` to the ``BASE_38_TABLE``. Both tables are safe for 
           uri's across all platforms, but the new table can encode information 
           slightly more efficiently.
        -  Major refactorings & signature changes across the package to make
           passing keys & salts to ``*_hmac`` functions & the ``Comprende`` 
           class' hash generators explicit.
        -  Removed the ``of`` keyword argument from all of the ``Comprende`` 
           class' generators. It was overly complicating the code, & was not
           entirely clear or useful for settings outside of the ``tags`` & 
           ``atags`` generators.
        -  Removed ``pybase64`` from the package & its dependencies list. The
           built-in python ``base64`` module works just fine.
        -  Sorted the ``WORDS_LIST``, ``ASCII_ALPHANUMERIC``, & ``BASE_64_TABLE``
           datasets.
        -  The ``salt`` & ``asalt`` functions have been renamed to ``generate_salt``
           & ``agenerate_salt`` for clarity's sake, & to reduce naming 
           collisions.
        -  Added another redundancy to the ``arandom_number_generator`` &
           ``random_number_generator`` functions. Now the async tasks it prepares
           into a list are pseudo-randomly shuffled before being passed into 
           ``asyncio.gather``.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added a logo image to the package.
        -  Separated the FAQ section from ``PREADME.rst``.
        -  The ``primes`` & ``bits`` datasets are now represented in hex in the
           source code.
        -  Added a ``BASE_38_TABLE`` dataset to the package.
        -  The database classes now fill an ephemeral dictionary of filenames
           that couldn't be used to successfully load a tag file, available from 
           within the ``_corrupted_files`` attribute.
        -  The ``Comprende`` class' ``acache_check`` & ``cache_check`` context
           manager methods are now called ``aauto_cache`` & ``auto_cache``.
        -  Added new ``bytes_count`` & ``abytes_count`` generators to ``generics.py``
           module which increment each iteration & yield the results as bytes.
        -  Removed the ``akeypair`` & ``keypair`` functions from the package. 
           Their successors are the ``asingle_use_key`` & ``single_use_key`` methods
           in the ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes. The attempt is to clarify &
           put constraints on the interface for creating a bundle of key 
           material that has a single-use-only salt attached, as well as the pid 
           value. 
        -  Moved ciphertext encoding functions into the ``BytesIO`` class from
           the global ``generics.py`` module.
        -  Split ``PrimeGroups`` into two classes, one higher-level class by the
           same name & a ``BasePrimeGroups`` class. The former also has some
           added functionality for masking the order of bytes in a sequence 
           using an modular exponentiation.
        -  The ``Hasher`` class now has functionality added to mask the order
           of a bytes sequence with a modular multiplication.
        -  Fixed the name of the project in the attribution lines in several 
           source files.
        -  Reconciled tests with the major changes in this release.
        -  The old identity key for the package that was signed by the gnupg 
           identity key was shredded & replaced with a new signed key.
        -  Several bug fixes to the ``setup.py`` automated code signing.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.17.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: The HMAC verifiers on ciphertexts did not include 
           the ``salt`` or ``pid`` values when deriving the HMAC. This 
           associated data can therefore be changed to cause a party to
           decrypt a past ciphertext with a salt or pid of an attacker's
           choosing. This is a critical vulnerability & it is highly recommended
           all users update. The fix is to hash the ciphertext, ``salt`` 
           & ``pid`` together & sending that hash into the validator to have
           the HMAC created / tested. This change will cause all prior 
           ciphertexts to be marked invalid by the validator.
        -  Refactored the names of the Comprende cipher methods to better 
           communicate their intended use as lower level tools that cannot be
           used on their own to obtain authenticated, CCA or CPA secure 
           encryption.
        -  Added more comprehensive tests for ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes,
           as well as the protocols that utilize the ``X25519`` ecdh exchange.
           Fixed some bugs in the process.
        -  ``X25519`` instances that contain a secret key now have access to
           protocol methods which automatically pass their key in as a keyword
           argument. This simplifies their usage further.
        -  Incorporated the new ``Hasher`` class into the package's random
           number generator to improve its entropy production.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various fixes to typos, docstrings & tutorials.
        -  New tutorials & docs added.
        -  Changed the default table in ``ByteIO`` 's ``json_to_ascii``, ``ajson_to_ascii``,
           ``ascii_to_json`` & ``aascii_to_json`` to the ``URL_SAFE_TABLE`` to 
           facilitate the creation of urlsafe_tokens.
        -  Removed all code in the ``Ropake`` class that was used to create a default
           database to store a default salt for users. All of that functionality 
           is expected to be handled by the database classes' token & profile 
           creation tools.
        -  Fixed bug in package signing script that called hex from a string.
        -  Updated the package signing script to include these metadata in the
           signatures of the ephemeral keys: name of the package, version, the 
           date in seconds.
        -  Added metadata to the ``setup.cfg`` file.
        -  Make passcrypt objects available from the ``keygens`` module.
        -  Add more consistent ability within ``Ropake`` class to specify a
           time-to-live for protocol messages.
        -  Added check to make sure instances of ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` are
           not trying to import a new secret key once they already have one. 
           This won't be allowed in favor of creating a new object for a new
           secret key.
        -  Fixed bug in database classes' bytes ciphers which called themselves
           recursively instead of calling the global functions of the same name.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.16.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  All ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` filenames have been converted to
           base36 to aid in making the manifest files & the databases as a whole 
           more space efficient. These changes are not backwards compatible.
        -  More work was done to clean up the databases & make them more 
           efficient, as well as equalize the sizes of the database files to
           mitigate leaking metadata about what they might contain. 
        -  Added new ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes that greatly simplify the
           usage of the cryptography module's 25519 based tools. They also help
           organize the codebase better -- where ``Ropake`` was holding onto
           all of the asymmetric tooling even though those tools were not part
           of the Ropake protocol.
        -  New base & helper ``Asymmetric25519`` & ``BaseEllipticCurve`` classes 
           were added as well to facilitate the reorganization.
        -  Many methods in ``Ropake`` were turned private to simplify & clean up 
           the interface so its intended use as a protocol is more clear for users.
        -  Added the time-to-live functionality to ``Ropake`` decryption functions.
           The ``TIMEOUT`` attribute on the class can also be changed to import 
           a global time-to-live for all ``Ropake`` ciphertexts.
        -  Removed all ``nc_`` hash functions from the package/generics.py module.
        -  The ``Namespace`` class now has a ``keys`` method so that namespaces
           can be unpacked using star-star syntax.
        -  Because of the ongoing failures of gnupg, we are moving away from 
           signing our packages with gnupg. Our new Ed25519 keys will be from
           the cryptography package, & we'll sign those with our gnupg key as a
           secondary form of attestation. Our package signing will be automated
           in the setup.py file & the methods we use will be transparent in the 
           code. The new signatures for each package version will be placed in 
           the file ``SIGNATURES.txt``.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Many fixes & additions to docstrings & tutorials.
        -  Massive refactorings, cleanups & typo fixes across the library, 
           especially in the database classes, ``Ropake`` & the ``ciphers`` module.
        -  Added comprehensive functional tests for the Ropake class.
        -  Added ``BASE_36_TABLE`` to the ``commons`` module.
        -  Fixed metadata issues in setup.py that caused upload issues to pypi.
        -  The ``generate_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``agenerate_profile`` &
           ``aload_profile`` database methods now accept arbitrary keyword arguments 
           that get passed into the database's __init__ constructor.
        -  ``username`` & ``password`` are now required keyword-only arguments
           to the ``agenerate_profile_tokens`` & ``generate_profile_tokens`` 
           classmethods.
        -  The ``aload`` & ``load`` database methods now take a ``manifest`` kwarg
           that when toggled ``True`` will also refresh the manifest file from 
           disk.
        -  Now when a database object is ordered to delete itself, the entirety 
           of the instance's caches & attribute values are cleared & deleted.
        -  Filled out the references to strong key generators & protocols in the
           ``keygens`` module.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.15.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: The previous update left the default salt stored by
           the ``Ropake`` class on the user filesystem as an empty string  for
           new files that were created since the ``asalt`` & ``salt`` functions
           were switched to producing 256-bit values instead of 512-bits. This
           bug has now been fixed.
        -  An 8 byte timestamp is now prepended to each plaintext during the
           padding step. The decryption functions now take a ``ttl`` kwarg which
           will measure & enforce a time-to-live for ciphertexts under threat of
           ``TimeoutError``.
        -  Added new profile feature to the database classes. This standardizes
           & simplifies the process for users to open databases using only 
           low-entropy "profile" information such as ``username``, ``password``,
           ``*credentials`` & an optional ``salt`` a user may have access to. 
           The new ``agenerate_profile_tokens``, ``generate_profile_tokens``, 
           ``agenerate_profile``, ``generate_profile``, ``aprofile_exists``, 
           ``profile_exists``, ``aload_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``adelete_profile``
           & ``delete_profile`` functions are the public part of this new feature.
        -  Some more database class attributes have been turned private to clean
           up the api.
        -  Fixed typo in ``__exit__`` method of ``Database`` class which referenced 
           a method which had its name refactored, leading to a crash.
        -  Shifted the values in the ``primes`` dictionary such that the key for
           each element in the dictionary is the exclusive maximum of each prime
           in that element. Ex: primes[512][-1].to_bytes(64, "big") is now valid.
           Whereas before, primes[512] was filled with primes that were 64 bytes
           and 1 bit long, making them 65 byte primes. This changes some of the
           values of constants in the package & therefore some values derived 
           from those constants.
        -  Slimmed down the number of elements in the ``primes`` & ``bits`` 
           dictionaries, reducing the size of the package a great deal. ``primes``
           now contains two primes in each element, the first is the minimum 
           prime of that bit length, the latter the maximum.
        -  Added ``URLSAFE_TABLE`` to the package.
        -  Made ``salt`` & ``pid`` & ``ttl`` keyword only arguments in key 
           generators & encryption / decryption functions, further tighening up
           the api.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``this_second`` function to ``asynchs`` module for integer time.
        -  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & 
           ``plaintext_stream`` functions to the ``ciphers`` module.
        -  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key`` to the ``keygens`` module &
           ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes.
        -  Added ``axi_mix``, ``xi_mix``, ``acheck_timestamp``, ``check_timestamp``,
           to the ``generics`` module.
        -  Added ``acsprbg``, ``csprbg``, ``asalt``, ``salt``, ``apadding_key``, 
           ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & ``plaintext_stream`` functions
           to OneTimePad class as ``staticmethod`` & instance methods.
        -  Added ``acheck_timestamp`` & ``check_timestamp`` functions to the 
           ``BytesIO`` class.
        -  Added ``adeniable_filename`` & ``deniable_filename`` to the ``paths`` 
           module. 
        -  Removed check for falsey data in encryption functions. Empty data is 
           & should be treated as valid plaintext.
        -  Various refactorings, docstring fixes & efficiency improvements.
        -  Added some new tests for database profiles.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.14.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security patch: The ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` &
           ``depad_bytes`` functions were changed internally to execute in a
           more constant time. The variations were small for 256-byte buffers
           (the default), but can grow very wide with larger buffers. The salt
           in the package's encryption utilities is now used to derive the 
           plaintext's padding, making each padding unique. 
        -  Unified the types of encodings the library's encryption functions
           utilize for producing ciphertext. This includes databases. They now
           all use the ``LIST_ENCODING``. This greatly increases the efficiency
           of the databases' encryption/decryption, save/load times. And this
           encoding is more space efficient. This change is backwards
           incompatible.
        -  The ``LIST_ENCODING`` specification was also changed to produce
           smaller ciphertexts. The salt is no longer encrypted & included as
           the first 256 byte chunk of ciphertext. It is now packaged along with
           ciphertext in the clear & is restricted to being a 256-bit hex
           string.
        -  The interfaces for the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` were cleaned
           up. Many attributes & functions that were not intended as the public
           interface of the classes were made "private". Also, the no longer
           used utilities for encrypting & decrypting under the MAP_ENCODING
           were removed.
        -  Updated the ``abytes_xor``, ``bytes_xor``, ``axor`` & ``xor`` generators 
           to shrink the size of the ``seed`` that's fed into the ``keystream``. This
           allows the one-time-pad cipher to be more cpu efficient.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Fixed various typos, docstrings & tutorials that have no kept up
           with the pace of changes.
        -  Various refactorings throughout.
        -  The ``akeypair`` & ``keypair`` functions now produce a ``Namespace``
           populated with a 512-bit hex key & a 256-bit hex salt to be more
           consistent with their intended use-case with the one-time-pad cipher.
        -  Removed ``aencode_salt``, ``encode_salt``, ``adecode_salt`` & 
           ``decode_salt`` functions since they are no longer used in conjunction
           with LIST_ENCODING ciphertexts.
        -  Updated tests to recognize these changes.
        -  Gave the ``OneTimePad`` class access to a ``BytesIO`` object under a
           new ``io`` attribute.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.13.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Security Patch: ``xor`` & ``axor`` functions that define the 
           one-time-pad cipher had a vulnerability fixed that can leak <1-bit of
           plaintext. The issue was in the way keys were built, where the
           multiplicative products of two key segments were xor'd together. This
           lead to keys being slightly more likely to be positive integers, 
           meaning the final bit had a greater than 1/2 probability of being a 
           ``0``. The fix is accompanied with an overhaul of the one-time-pad 
           cipher which is more efficient, faster, & designed with a better 
           understanding of the way bytes are processed & represented. The key
           chunks now do not, & must not, surpass 256 bytes & neither should 
           any chunk of plaintext output. Making each chunk deterministically 
           256 bytes allows for reversibly formatting ciphertext to & from 
           bytes-like strings. These changes are backwards incompatible with 
           prior versions of this package & are strongly recommended.
        -  Added ``bytes_xor`` & ``abytes_xor`` functions which take in key 
           generators which produce key segments of type bytes instead of hex 
           strings.
        -  ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now save files in bytes format,
           making them much more efficient on disk space. They use the new
           ``BytesIO`` class in the ``generics`` module to transparently convert
           to & from json & bytes. This change is also not backwards compatible.
        -  Removed ``acipher``, ``cipher``, ``adecipher``, ``decipher``,
           ``aorganize_encryption_streams``, ``organize_encryption_streams``,
           ``aorganize_decryption_streams``, ``organize_decryption_streams``,
           ``aencrypt``, ``encrypt``, ``adecrypt``, ``decrypt``, ``asubkeys`` &
           ``subkeys`` generators from the ``ciphers`` module & package to slim 
           down the code, remove repetition & focus on the cipher tools that 
           include hmac authentication.
        -  Removed deprecated diffie-hellman methods in ``Ropake`` class. 
        -  Removed the static ``power10`` dictionary from the package.
        -  The default secret salt for the ``Ropake`` class is now derived from the 
           contents of a file that's in the databases directory which is chmod'd to 
           0o000 unless needed. 
        -  Made ``aclient_message_key``, ``client_message_key``, ``aserver_message_key``, 
           & ``server_message_key`` ``Ropake`` class methods to help distinguish 
           client-to-server & server-to-client message keys which prevents replay 
           attacks on the one-message ROPAKE protocol. 
        -  Added protocol coroutines to the ``Ropake`` class which allow for easily
           engaging in 2DH & 3DH elliptic curve exchanges for servers & clients.
        -  Efficiency improvements to the ``aseeder`` & ``seeder`` generator functions
           in the ``randoms`` module. This affects the ``acsprng`` & ``csprng`` objects
           & all the areas in the library that utilize those objects.
        -  Changed the repr behavior of ``Comprende`` instances to redact all args &
           kwargs by default to protect cryptographic material from unintentionally
           being displayed on user systems. The repr can display full contents by 
           calling the ``enable_debugging`` method of the ``DebugControl`` class.
        -  All generator functions decorated with ``comprehension`` are now given
           a ``root`` attribute. This allows direct access to the function without
           needing to instantiate or run it as a ``Comprende`` object. This saves 
           a good deal of cpu & time in the overhead that would otherwise be 
           incurred by the class. This is specifically more helpful in tight &/or
           lower-level looping.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings across the library. 
        -  Fixed various typos, bugs & inaccurate docstrings throughout the library.
        -  Add ``chown`` & ``chmod`` functions to the ``asynchs.aos`` module. 
        -  Now makes new ``multiprocessing.Manager`` objects in the ``asynchs.Processes`` 
           & ``asynchs.Threads`` classes to avoid errors that occur when using a stale 
           object whose socket connections are closed. 
        -  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``adb_login`` & ``db_login`` methods to 
           ``adatabase_login_key`` & ``database_login_key``. Also, fix a crash bug in 
           those methods. 
        -  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``aec25519_pub``, ``ec25519_pub``, ``aec25519_priv`` 
           & ``ec25519_priv`` methods to ``aec25519_public_bytes``, ``ec25519_public_bytes``, 
           ``aec25519_private_bytes`` & ``ec25519_private_bytes``. 
        -  Added low-level private methods to ``Ropake`` class which do derivation 
           & querying of the default class key & salt. 
        -  Behavior changes to the ``ainverse_int`` & ``inverse_int`` functions in the 
           ``generics`` module to allow handling bases represented in ``str`` or ``bytes`` 
           type strings. 
        -  Behavior & name changes to the ``abinary_tree`` & ``binary_tree`` functions in the 
           ``generics`` module to ``abuild_tree`` & ``build_tree``. They now allow making 
           uniform trees of any width & depth, limited only by the memory in a 
           user's machine. 
        -  Provided new ``acsprbg`` & ``csprbg`` objects to the library that return 512-bits 
           of cryptographically secure pseudo-random ``bytes`` type strings. They are 
           made by the new ``abytes_seeder`` & ``bytes_seeder`` generators. 
        -  The ``csprng``, ``acsprng``, ``csprbg`` & ``acsprbg`` objects were 
           wrapped in functions that automatically restart the generators if they're
           stalled / interrupted during a call. This keeps the package from melting
           down if it can no longer call the CSPRNGs for new entropy.
        -  Cleaned up & simplified ``table_key`` functions in the ``keygens`` module. 
        -  Changed the output of ``asafe_symm_keypair`` & ``safe_symm_keypair`` functions 
           to contain bytes values not their hex-only representation. Also removed 
           these functions from the main imports of the package since they are slow 
           & their main contribution is calling ``arandom_number_generator`` & 
           ``random_number_generator`` to utilize a large entropy pool when starting
           CSPRNGs.
        -  Added new values to the ``bits`` dictionary.
        -  Added ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` & ``depad_bytes``
           functions which use ``shake_256`` to pad/depad plaintext bytes to & from
           multiples of 256 bytes. They take in a key to create the padding. 
           This method is intended to also aid in protecting against padding
           oracle attacks.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.12.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  The OPAKE protocol was renamed to ROPAKE, an acronym for Ratcheting 
           Opaque Password Authenticated Key Exchange. This change was necessary 
           since OPAKE is already a name for an existing PAKE protocol. This change 
           also means the ``Opake`` class name was changed to ``Ropake``. 
        -  The ``Ropake`` class' registration algorithm was slightly modified to 
           use the generated Curve25519 ``shared_key`` an extra time in the key 
           derivation process. This shouldn't break any currently authenticated 
           sessions. 
        -  The ``asyncio_contextmanager`` package is no longer a listed dependency 
           in ``setup.py``. The main file from that package was copied over into the 
           ``/aiootp`` directory in order to remove the piece of code that caused 
           warnings to crop up when return values were retrieved from async 
           generators. This change will put an end to this whack-a-mole process of 
           trying to stop the warnings with try blocks scattered about the codebase. 
        -  Added ``asave_tag``, ``save_tag``, ``asave_file`` & ``save_file`` methods 
           to the database classes so that specific entries can be saved to disk 
           without having to save the entire database which is much more costly. The 
           manifest file isn't saved to disk when these methods are used, so if a 
           tag file isn't already saved in the database, then the saved files will 
           not be present in the manifest or in the cache upon subsequent loads of 
           the database. The saved file will still however be saved on the 
           filesystem, though unbeknownst to the database instance.
        -  The ``Namespace`` class now redacts all obvious key material in instance 
           repr's, which is any 64+ hex character string, or any number with 64+ 
           decimal digits. 
        -  Removed the experimental recursive value retrieval within ``Comprende``'s 
           ``__aexamine_sent_exceptions`` & ``__examine_sent_exceptions`` methods. 
           This change leads to more reliable & faster code, in exchange for an 
           unnecessary feature being removed. 
        -  Bug fix of the ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` methods by editing the code in 
           the ``asyncio_contextmanager`` dependency & using the patched package 
           instead of the ``comprehension`` decorator for the ``arelay`` & ``relay`` 
           methods of ``Comprende``. Their internal algorithms was also updated to 
           be simpler, but are incompatible with the outputs of past versions of 
           these methods. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & documentation additions / modifications throughout 
           the library. 
        -  Various small bug fixes.
        -  The shared keys derived from the ``Ropake`` protocol are now returned in 
           a ``Namespace`` object instead of a raw dictionary, which allows the 
           values to be retrieved by dotted &/or bracketed lookup. 
        -  The ``atest_hmac`` & ``test_hmac`` algorithms / methods were made more 
           efficient & were refactored. Now they call ``atime_safe_equality`` &
           ``time_safe_equality`` internally, which are new methods that can apply
           the non-constant time but randomized timing comparisons on any pairs of
           values.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.11.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  The Opake protocol was made greatly more efficient. This was done by 
           replacing the diffie-hellman verifiers with a hash & xor commit & reveal
           system. Most hashing was made more efficient my using quicker & smaller
           ``sha_512`` function instead of ``nc_512``, & streamlining the protocol.
        -  The ``Opake.client`` & ``Opake.client_registration`` methods now take
           an instantiated client database instead of client credentials which 
           improves security, efficiency & usability. This change reduces the amount
           of exposure received by user passwords & other credentials. It also 
           simplifies usage of the protocol by only needing to carry around a 
           database instead of a slew of credentials, which is also faster, since
           the credentials are passed through the cpu & memory hard ``passcrypt``
           function everytime to open the database.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Heavy refactorings & documentation additions / modifications of the 
           ``Opake`` class. Removed the ``Opake.ainit_database`` & ``Opake.init_database``
           methods, & made the ``salt`` default argument parameter in 
           ``Opake.aclient_database``, ``Opake.client_database``, ``Opake.adb_login`` &
           ``Opake.db_login`` into a keyword only argument so any extra user defined
           ``credentials`` are able to be passed without specifying a salt.
        -  The decorators for the ``Comprende.arelay`` & ``Comprende.relay`` methods 
           were changed from ``@asyncio_contextmanager.async_contextmanager`` to
           ``@comprehension()`` to stop that package from raising exceptions when
           we retrieve return values from async generators.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.10.1 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` classes to ``asynchs.py`` which abstract 
           spawning & getting return values from async & sync functions intended to 
           be run in threads, processes or pools of the former types. This simplifies 
           & adds time control to usages of processes & threads throughout the 
           library. 
        -  Reduced the effectiveness of timing analysis of the modular exponentiation 
           in the ``Opake`` class' verifiers by making the process return values 
           only after discrete intervals of time. Timing attacks on that part of the 
           protocol may still be viable, but should be significantly reduced. 
        -  Bug fix in ``Comprende`` which should take care of warnings raised from 
           the ``aiocontext`` package when retrieving async generator values by 
           raising ``UserWarning`` within them. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Heavy refactorings of the ``Opake`` class. 
        -  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
        -  Further add ``return_exceptions=True`` flag to gather calls in ``ciphers.py``. 
        -  Added ``is_registration`` & ``is_authentication`` which take a client 
           hello message that begin the ``Opake`` protocol, & return ``False`` if 
           the message is not either a registration or authentication message, 
           respectively, & return ``"Maybe"`` otherwise, since these functions can't 
           determine without running the protocol whether or not the message is 
           valid. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.10.0 
        ========================== 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added a new oblivious, one-message, password authenticated key exchange 
           protocol class in ``aiootp.ciphers.Opake``. It is a first attempt at the 
           protocol, which works rather well, but may be changed or cleaned up in a 
           future update. 
        -  Added the ``cryptography`` package as a dependency for elliptic curve 
           25519 diffie-hellman key exchange in the ``Opake`` protocol. 
        -  Fix buggy data processing functions in ``generics.py`` module. 
        -  Added ``silent`` flag to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` methods, which 
           allows their instances to finish initializing even if a file is missing 
           from the filesystem, normally causing a ``FileNotFoundError``. This makes 
           trouble-shooting corrupted databases easier. 
        -  Added new ``aiootp.paths.SecurePath`` function which returns the path to 
           a unique directory within the database's default directory. The name of 
           the returned directory is a cryptographic value used to create & open the 
           default database used by the ``Opake`` class to store the cryptographic 
           salt that secures the class' client passwords. It's highly recommended 
           to override this default database by instantiating the Opake class with 
           a custom user-defined key. The instance doesn't need to be saved, since 
           all the class' methods are either class or static methods. The ``__init__`` 
           method only changes the class' default database to one opened with the 
           user-defined ``key`` &/or ``directory`` kwargs, & should really only be 
           done once at the beginning of an application. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
        -  Added ``Comprende`` class feature to return the values from even the 
           generators within an instance's arguments. This change better returns 
           values to the caller from chains of ``Comprende`` generators. 
        -  Fixed ``commons.BYTES_TABLE`` missing values. 
        -  Added ``commons.DH_PRIME_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` & ``commons.DH_GENERATOR_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` 
           constants for use in the ``Opake`` protocol's public key verifiers. 
        -  Added other values to the ``commons.py`` module. 
        -  Added new very large no-collision hash functions to the ``generics.py`` 
           module used to xor with diffie-hellman public keys in the ``Opake`` class. 
        -  Added new ``wait_on`` & ``await_on`` ``Comprende`` generators to ``generics.py`` 
           which waits for a queue or container to be populated & yields it whenever 
           it isn't empty. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.3 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Speed & efficiency improvements in the ``Comprende`` class & ``azip``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various refactorings & code cleanups.
        -  Added ``apop`` & ``pop`` ``Comprende`` generators to the library.
        -  Switched the default character table in the ``ato_base``, ``to_base``, 
           ``afrom_base``, & ``from_base`` chainable generator methods from the 62
           character ``ASCII_ALPHANUMERIC`` table, to the 95 character ``ASCII_TABLE``.
        -  Made the digits generators in ``randoms.py`` automatically create a new
           cryptographically secure key if a key isn't passed by a user.
        -  Some extra data processing functions added to ``generics.py``.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.2 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` instance methods to ``OneTimePad``,
           ``Keys``, & ``AsyncKeys`` classes. They produce password hashes that are
           not just secured by the salt & passcrypt algorithm settings, but also by
           their main symmetric instance keys. This makes passwords infeasible to
           crack without also compromising the instance's 512-bit key.
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Further improvements to the random number generator in ``randoms.py``.
           Made its internals less sequential thereby raising the bar of work needed
           by an attacker to successfully carry out an order prediction attack.
        -  Added checks in the ``Passcrypt`` class to make sure both a salt & 
           password were passed into the algorithm.
        -  Switched ``PermissionError`` exceptions in ``Passcrypt._validate_args``
           to ``ValueError`` to be more consistent with the rest of the class.
        -  Documentation updates / fixes.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.1 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Now any falsey values for the ``salt`` keyword argument in the library's 
           ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, & 
           ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators, & other functions around the 
           library, will cause them to generate a new cryptographically secure 
           pseudo-random value for the salt. It formerly only did this when ``salt`` 
           was ``None``. 
        -  The ``seeder`` & ``aseeder`` generators have been updated to introduce 
           512 new bits of entropy from ``secrets.token_bytes`` on every iteration 
           to ensure that the CSPRNG will produce secure outputs even if its 
           internal state is somehow discovered. This also allows for simply calling 
           the CSPRNG is enough, there's no longer a strong reason to pass new 
           entropy into it manually, except to add even more entropy as desired.
        -  Made ``size`` the last keywordCHECKSUMS.txt argument in ``encrypt`` & 
           ``aencrypt`` to better mirror the signatures for rest of the library. 
        -  Added ``token_bits`` & ``atoken_bits`` functions to ``randoms.py`` which 
           are renamings of ``secrets.randbits``. 
        -  Refactored & improved the security og ``randoms.py``'s random number 
           generator. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.9.0 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added hmac codes to ciphertext for the following functions: ``json_encrypt``, 
           ``ajson_encrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_encrypt``, 
           ``Database.encrypt`` & ``AsyncDatabase.aencrypt``. This change greatly 
           increases the security of ciphertext by ensuring it hasn't been modified 
           or tampered with maliciously. One-time pad ciphertext is maleable, so 
           without hmac validation it can be changed to successfully allow 
           decryption but return the wrong plaintext. These functions are the 
           highest level abstractions of the library for encryption/decryption, 
           which made them excellent targets for this important security update. 
           As well, it isn't easily possible for the library to provide hmac codes 
           for generators that produce ciphertext, because the end of a stream of 
           ciphertext isn't known until after the results have left the scope 
           of library code. So users will need to produce their own hmac codes for 
           generator ciphertext unless we find an elegant solution to this issue. 
           These functions now all return dictionaries with the associated hmac 
           stored in the ``"hmac"`` entry. The bytes functions formerly returned 
           lists, now their ciphertext is available from the ``"ciphertext"`` entry. 
           And, all database files will have an hmac attached to them now. These 
           changes were designed to still be compatible with old ciphertexts but 
           they'll likely be made incompatible by the v0.11.x major release. 
        -  Only truthy values are now valid ``key`` keyword arguments in the 
           library's ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, 
           & ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators. Also now seeding extra entropy 
           into ``csprng`` & ``acsprng`` when ``salt`` is falsey within them. 
        -  Only truthy values are now valid for ``password`` & ``salt`` arguments in 
           ``apasscrypt``, ``passcrypt`` & their variants. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Updates to documentation & ``README.rst`` tutorials.
        -  The ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments in ``sum_passcrypt`` &
           ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods were switched to keyword
           only arguments.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.8.1 
        ========================= 
        
        
        Major Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Added ``sum_passcrypt`` & ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods 
           to ``Comprende`` class. They cumulatively apply the passcrypt algorithm 
           to each yielded value from an underlying generator with the passcrypt'd 
           prior yielded result used as a salt. This allows making proofs of work, 
           memory & space-time out of iterations of the passcrypt algorithm very 
           simple. 
        
        
        Minor Changes 
        ------------- 
        
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed. 
        -  Various refactorings of the codebase. 
        -  Made ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments into keyword only arguments 
           in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes. 
        -  The ``length`` keyword argument in functions around the library was 
           changed to ``size`` to be consistent across the whole package. Reducing 
           the cognitive burden of memorizing more than one name for the same concept. 
        -  Various efficiency boosts. 
        -  Edits to ``README.rst``. 
        -  Added ``encode_salt``, ``aencode_salt``, ``decode_salt`` & ``adecode_salt`` 
           functions to the library, which gives access to the procedure used to 
           encrypt & decrypt the random salt which is often the first element 
           produced in one-time pad ciphertexts. 
        -  Added cryptographically secure pseudo-random values as default keys in 
           encryption functions to safeguard against users accidentally encrypting 
           data without specifying a key. This way, such mistakes will produce 
           ciphertext with an unrecoverable key, instead of without a key at all. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.8.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix ``test_hmac``, ``atest_hmac`` functions in the keys & database 
           classes. The new non-constant-time algorithm needs a random salt to be 
           added before doing the secondary hmac to prevent some potential exotic 
           forms of chosen plaintext/ciphertext attacks on the algorithm. The last 
           version of the algorithm should not be used. 
        -  The ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` interfaces were overhauled to remove the 
           persistance of instance salts. They were intended to be updated by users 
           with the ``reset`` & ``areset`` methods, but that cannot be guaranteed 
           easily through the class, so it is an inappropriate interface since 
           reusing salts for encryption is completely insecure. The instances do
           still maintain state of their main encryption key, & new stateful methods
           for key generation, like ``mnemonic`` & ``table_key``, have been added.
           The ``state`` & ``astate`` methods have been removed.
        -  Gave ``OneTimePad`` instances new stateful methods from the ``ciphers.py`` 
           module & ``keygens.py`` keys classes. Its instances now remember the main 
           symmetric key behind the ``key`` property & automatically passes it as a 
           keyword argument to the methods in ``OneTimePad.instance_methods``.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Update ``CHANGES.rst`` file with the updates that were not logged for
           v0.7.1.
        -  ``BYTES_TABLE`` was turned into a list so that the byte characters can 
           be retrieved instead of their ordinal numbers.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.7.1
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix a mistake in the signatures of ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt. The args
           ``kb``, ``cpu`` & ``hardness`` were changed into keyword only arguments
           to mitigate user mistakes, but the internal calls to those functions were
           still using positional function calls, which broke the api. This issue
           is now fixed.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.7.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Replaced usage of bare ``random`` module functions, to usage of an 
           instance of ``random.Random`` to keep from messing with user's settings 
           on that module. 
        -  Finalized the algorithm for the ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions. 
           The algorithm is now provably memory & cpu hard with a wide security 
           margin with adequate settings. The algorithm isn't likely change with 
           upcoming versions unless a major flaw is found. 
        -  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` 
           is now ``3`` & now directly determines how many hash iterations are done 
           for each element in the memory cache. This provides much more 
           responsiveness to users & increases the capacity to impact resource cost
           with less tinkering. 
        -  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
           scheme which is not constant time, but which instead does not leak useful 
           information. It does this by not comparing the hmacs of the data, but of 
           a pair of secondary hmacs. The timing analysis itself is now dependant 
           on knowledge of the key, since any conclusions of such an analysis would 
           be unable correlate its findings with any supplied hmac without it. 
        -  Added  ``test_hmac`` & ``atest_hmac`` to the database classes, & changed 
           their hmac algorithm from ``sha3_512`` to ``sha3_256``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate function signatures.
        -  Added ``mnemonic`` & ``amnemonic`` key generators to ``keygens.py`` with
           a wordlist 2048 entries long. A custom wordlist can also be passed in.
        -  Minor changes in ``Comprende`` to track down a bug in the functions that 
           use the asyncio_contextmanager package. It causes a warning when asking
           async generators to return (not yield) values.
        -  Some refactoring of ``random_number_generator`` & ``arandom_number_generator``.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.6.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Replaced the usage of ``os.urandom`` within the package with 
           ``secrets.token_bytes`` to be more reliable across platforms. 
        -  Replaced several usages of ``random.randrange`` within ``randoms.py`` to 
           calls to ``secrets.token_bytes`` which is faster & more secure. It
           now also seeds ``random`` module periodically prior to usage.
        -  Changed the internal cache sorting algorithm of ``passcrypt`` & 
           ``apasscrypt`` functions. The key function passed to ``list.sort(key=key)`` 
           now not only updates the ``hashlib.sha3_512`` proof object with 
           each element in the cache, but with it's own current output. This change 
           is incompatible with previous versions of the functions. The key function 
           is also trimmed down of unnecessary value checking. 
        -  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``
           is now ``40_000``. This is right at the edge of when the argument begins
           impacting the cpu work needed to comptute the password hash when the ``kb``
           argument is the default of ``1024``.
        -  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
           constant time algorithm.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
        -  Added a ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`` instance to the ``asynchs``
           module for easily spinning off threads. It's available under 
           ``asynchs.thread_pool``.
        -  Added ``sort`` & ``asort`` chainable generator method to the ``Comprende`` 
           class. They support sorting by a ``key`` sorting function as well.
        -  Changed the name of ``asynchs.executor_wrapper`` to ``asynchs.wrap_in_executor``.
        -  Changed the name of ``randoms.non0_digit_stream``, ``randoms.anon0_digit_stream``,
           ``randoms.digit_stream`` & ``randoms.adigit_stream`` to ``randoms.non_0_digits``,
           ``randoms.anon_0_digits``, ``randoms.digits`` & ``randoms.adigits``.
        -  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
        -  ``apasscrypt`` & ``Passcrypt.anew`` now use the synchronous version of the 
           algorithm internally because it's faster & it doesn't change the 
           parallelization properties of the function since it's already run 
           automatically in another process.
        -  Added ``shuffle``, ``ashuffle``, ``unshuffle``, & ``aunshuffle`` functions
           to ``randoms.py`` that reorder sequences pseudo-randomly based on their
           ``key`` & ``salt`` keyword arguments.
        -  Fixed bugs in ``AsyncKeys`` & ``debuggers.py``.
        -  Added ``debugger`` & ``adebugger`` chainable generator methods to the
           ``Comprende`` class which benchmarks & inspects running generators with
           an inline syntax.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.5.1
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed a bug in the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` of the database classes 
           that assigned to a variable within a closure that was nonlocal but which 
           wasn't declared non-local. This caused an error which made the methods 
           unusable. 
        -  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions which are designed to be 
           tunably memory & cpu hard password-based key derivation function. It was 
           inspired by the scrypt protocol but internally uses the library's tools. 
           It is a first attempt at the protocol, it's internal details will likely 
           change in future updates. 
        -  Added ``bytes_keys`` & ``abytes_keys`` generators, which are just like 
           the library's ``keys`` generator, except they yield the concatenated 
           ``sha3_512.digest`` instead of the ``sha3_512.hexdigest``. 
        -  Added new chainable generator methods to the ``Comprende`` class for 
           processing bytes, integers, & hex strings into one another. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups.
        -  New tests added to the test suite for ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``.
        -  The ``Comprende`` class' ``alist`` & ``list`` methods can now be passed
           a boolean argument to return either a ``mutable`` list directly from the 
           lru_cache, or a copy of the cached list. This list is used by the 
           generator itself to yield its values, so wilely magic can be done on the
           list to mutate the underlying generator's results. 
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.5.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Added interfaces in ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` to handle encrypting
           & decrypting streams (``Comprende`` generators) instead of just raw json 
           data. They're methods called ``encrypt_stream``, ``decrypt_stream``,
           ``aencrypt_stream``, & ``adecrypt_stream``.
        -  Changed the attribute ``_METATAG`` used by ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` 
           to name the metatags entry in the database. This name is smaller, cleaner 
           & is used to prevent naming collisions between user entered values & the 
           metadata the classes need to organize themselves internally. This change 
           will break databases from older versions keeping them from accessing their 
           metatag child databases.
        -  Added the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database``
           which return coroutines that accept potentially sensitive identifiers &
           turns them into salted ``size`` length hashes distinguished by a ``salt``
           & a ``category``.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code & logic cleanups / speedups.
        -  Refactorings of the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` classes.
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.4.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed bug in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt`` function which inaccurately called
           a synchronous ``Comprende`` end-point method on the underlying async
           generator, causing an exception and failure to function.
        -  Changed the procedures in ``akeys`` & ``keys`` that generate their internal
           key derivation functions. They're now slightly faster to initialize &
           more theoretically secure since each internal state is fed by a seed
           which isn't returned to the user. This encryption algorithm change is 
           incompatible with the encryption algorithms of past versions.
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Various code cleanups.
        -  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.
        -  Keyword arguments in ``Keys().test_hmac`` & ``AsyncKeys().atest_hmac``
           had their order switched to be slightly more friendly to use.
        -  Added documentation to ``README.rst`` on the inner workings of the
           one-time-pad algorithm's implementation.
        -  Made ``Compende.arandom_sleep`` & ``Compende.random_sleep`` chainable
           generator methods.
        -  Changed the ``Compende.adelimit_resize`` & ``Compende.delimit_resize``
           algorithms to not yield inbetween two joined delimiters in a sequence
           being resized.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.3.1
        =========================
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed bug where a static method in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` was 
           wrongly labelled a class method causing a failure to initialize.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.3.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  The ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now use the more secure ``afilename`` 
           & ``filename`` methods to derive the hashmap name and encryption streams
           from a user-defined tag internal to their ``aencrypt`` / ``adecrypt`` / 
           ``encrypt`` / ``decrypt`` methods, as well as, prior to them getting called. 
           This will break past versions of databases' ability to open their files.
        -  The package now has built-in functions for using the one-time-pad 
           algorithm to encrypt & decrypt binary data instead of just strings
           or integers. They are available in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt``, 
           ``aiootp.abytes_decrypt``, ``aiootp.bytes_encrypt`` & ``aiootp.bytes_decrypt``.
        -  The ``Comprende`` class now has generators that do encryption & decryption 
           of binary data as well. They are available from any ``Comprende`` generator
           by the ``abytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_decrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt`` & ``bytes_decrypt`` 
           chainable method calls.
           
           
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fixed typos and inaccuracies in various docstrings.
        -  Added a ``__ui_coordination.py`` module to handle inserting functionality 
           from higher-level to lower-level modules and classes.
        -  Various code clean ups and redundancy eliminations.
        -  ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes now only update their ``self.salt`` key
           by default when their ``areset`` & ``reset`` methods are called. This
           aligns more closely with their intended use.
        -  Added ``arandom_sleep`` & ``random_sleep`` chainable methods to the
           ``Comprende`` class which yields outputs of generators after a random 
           sleep for each iteration.
        -  Added several other chainable methods to the ``Comprende`` class for
           string & bytes data processing. They're viewable in ``Comprende.lazy_generators``.
        -  Added new, initial tests to the test suite.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.2.0
        =========================
        
        
        Major Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Added ephemeral salts to the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` file 
           encryption procedures. This is a major security fix, as re-encryption 
           of files with the same tag in a database with the same open key would 
           use the same streams of key material each time, breaking encryption if 
           two different versions of a tag file's ciphertext stored to disk were 
           available to an adversary. The database methods ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``, 
           ``aencrypt`` & ``adecrypt`` will now produce and decipher true one-time 
           pad ciphertext with these ephemeral salts. 
        -  The ``aiootp.subkeys`` & ``aiootp.asubkeys`` generators were revamped 
           to use the ``keys`` & ``akeys`` generators internally instead of using 
           their own, slower algorithm. 
        -  ``AsyncDatabase`` file deletion is now asynchronous by running the 
           ``builtins.os.remove`` function in an async thread executor. The 
           decorator which does the magic is available at ``aiootp.asynchs.executor_wrapper``. 
        
        
        Minor Changes
        -------------
        
        -  Fix typos in ``__root_salt`` & ``__aroot_salt`` docstrings. Also replaced 
           the ``hash(self)`` argument for their ``lru_cache``  & ``alru_cache`` 
           with a secure hmac instead. 
        -  add ``gi_frame``, ``gi_running``, ``gi_code``, ``gi_yieldfrom``, 
           ``ag_frame``, ``ag_running``, ``ag_code`` & ``ag_await`` properties to 
           ``Comprende`` class to mirror async/sync generators more closely. 
        -  Remove ``ajson_encrypt``, ``ajson_decrypt``, ``json_encrypt``, 
           ``json_decrypt`` functions' internal creation of dicts to contain the 
           plaintext. It was unnecessary & therefore wasteful. 
        -  Fix docstrings in ``OneTimePad`` methods mentioning ``parent`` kwarg which 
           is a reference to deleted, refactored code. 
        -  Fix incorrect docstrings in databases ``namestream`` & ``anamestream`` 
           methods. 
        -  Added ``ASYNC_GEN_THROWN`` constant to ``Comprende`` class to try to stop 
           an infrequent & difficult to debug ``RuntimeError`` when async generators 
           do not stop after receiving an ``athrow``. 
        -  Database tags are now fully loaded when they're copied using the methods 
           ``into_namespace`` & ``ainto_namespace``. 
        -  Updated inaccurate docstrings in ``map_encrypt``, ``amap_encrypt``, 
           ``map_decrypt`` & ``amap_decrypt`` ``OneTimePad`` methods. 
        -  Added ``acustomize_parameters`` async function to ``aiootp.generics`` 
           module. 
        -  Various code clean ups.
        
        
        
        
        Changes for version 0.1.0 
        =========================
