Changes for version 0.20.0 (Backwards incompatible updates)
-----------------------------------------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The ``(a)json_(en/de)crypt`` & ``(a)bytes_(en/de)crypt`` functions &
   methods now only expect to work with ``bytes`` type ciphertext. And,
   the low-level cipher generators expect iterables of bytes where they
   used to expect iterables of integers.
-  The ``pid`` keyword-only argument throughout the package was changed
   to ``aad`` to more clearly communicate its purpose as authenticated
   additional data.
-  The ``key``, ``salt`` & ``aad`` values throughout the package are now
   expected to be ``bytes`` type values.
-  The ``key`` must now be at least 32-bytes for use within the ``Chunky2048``
   cipher & its interfaces.
-  The ``salt``, for use in the ``Chunky2048`` cipher & its interfaces, 
   was decreased from needing to be 32-bytes to 24-bytes.
-  The ``siv`` for use in the ``Chunky2048`` cipher & its interfaces was
   from needing to be 16-bytes to 24-bytes.
-  The new ``KeyAADBundle`` class was created as the primary interface
   for consuming ``key``, ``salt``, ``pid`` & ``siv`` values. This class'
   objects are the only ones that are used to pass around these values
   in low-level ``Chunky2048`` cipher functionalities. The higher-level
   cipher functions are the only public interfaces that still receive
   these ``key``, ``salt``, & ``pid`` values.
-  The ``KeyAADBundle`` now manages the new initial key derivation of the
   ``Chunky2048`` cipher. This new algorithm is much more efficient,
   utilizing the output of the keystream's first priming call instead of
   throwing it away, removing the need for several other previously used
   hashing calls.
-  The ``bytes_keys`` & ``abytes_keys`` keystream generator algorithms
   were improved & made more efficient. They also now only receive ``bytes``
   type coroutine values or ``None``.
-  The ``StreamHMAC`` algorithms were improved & made more efficient.
-  The ``Chunky2048`` class now creates instance's that initialize, & who's
   methods are callable, much more efficiently by reducing its previously
   dynamic structure. Its now reasonable to use these instances in code
   that has strict performance requirements.
-  The ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` classes were trimmed of all instance
   behaviour. They are now strictly namespaces which contain static or
   class methods.
-  All instance's of the word `password` throughout the package have been
   replaced with the word `passphrase`. The ``Passcrypt`` class now only
   accepts ``bytes`` type ``passphrase`` & ``salt`` values. The returned
   hashes are also now always ``bytes``.
-  The ``Padding`` & ``BytesIO`` classes' functionalities were made more
   efficient & cleaned up their implementations.
-  New ``PackageSigner`` & ``PackageVerifier`` classes were added to the
   ``keygens.py`` module to provide an intuituve API for users to sign their
   own packages. This package now also uses these classes to sign itself.
-  The new ``gentools.py`` module was created to organize the generator
   utilities that were previously scattered throughout the package's
   top-level namespaces.
-  The new ``_exceptions.py`` module was created to help organize the
   exceptions raised throughout the package, improving the readability
   & maintainability of the package.
-  The new ``_typing.py`` module was added to assist in the long process
   of adding functional type-hinting throughout the package. For now,
   the type hints that have been added primarily function as documentation.
-  A new ``Slots`` base class was added to the ``commons.py`` module to
   simplify the creation of more memory efficient & performant container
   classes. The new ``_containers.py`` module was made for such classes
   for use throughout the package. And, most classes throughout the
   package were given ``__slots__`` attributes.
-  A new ``OpenNamespace`` class was added which is a subclass of ``Namespace``
   with the only difference being that instances do not omit attributes
   from their repr's.
-  The new ``(a)bytes_are_equal`` functions, which are pointers to
   ``hmac.compare_digest`` from the standard library, have replaced the
   ``(a)time_safe_equality`` functions.
-  The ``(a)sha_256(_hmac)`` & ``(a)sha_512(_hmac)`` functions have had
   their names changed to ``(a)sha3__256(_hmac)`` & ``(a)sha3__256(_hmac)``.
   This was done to communicate that they are actually SHA3 functions,
   but the double underscore is to keep them differentiable from the
   standard library's ``hashlib`` objects. They can now also return
   ``bytes`` instead of hex strings if their ``hex`` keyword argument is truthy.
-  The base functionality of the ``Comprende`` class was refactored out into a
   ``BaseComprende`` class. The chainable data processor generator methods
   remain in the ``Comprende`` class. Their endpoint methods (such as ``(a)list``
   & ``(a)join``) have also been changed so they don't cache results by default.
-  The ``Passcrypt`` class' ``kb`` & ``hardness`` can now be set to values
   independently from one another. The algorithm runs on the new
   ``(a)bytes_keys`` coroutines, & a slightly more effective cache building
   procedure.
-  The databases classes now don't preload their values by default. And,
   various methods which work with tags & metatags have been given a
   ``cache`` keyword-only argument to toggle on/off the control of using
   the cache for each operation.
-  New method additions/changes to the database classes:

   -  ``(a)rollback_tag``, ``(a)clear_cache``, & a ``filenames`` property.
   -  ``(a)hmac`` was changed to ``(a)make_hmac``, & now returns ``bytes`` hashes.
   -  ``(a)save`` was changed to ``(a)save_database``.
   -  ``(a)query`` was changed to ``(a)query_tag``.
   -  ``(a)set`` was changed to ``(a)set_tag``.
   -  ``(a)pop`` was changed to ``(a)pop_tag``.
   -  The ``tags``, ``metatags`` & ``filenames`` properties now return sets
      instead of lists.

-  The ``Ropake`` class has been removed from the package pending changes to
   the protocol & its implementation.
-  The ``(a)generate_salt`` function now returns ``bytes`` type values,
   & takes a ``size`` keyword-only argument, with no default, that determines
   the number of bytes returned between [8, 64].
-  The ``(a)random_512`` & ``(a)random_256`` public functions can now cause
   their underlying random number generators to fill their entropy pools
   when either the ``rounds`` or ``refresh`` keyword arguments are specified.
-  The following variables were removed from the package:
   
   -  ``(a)keys``, ``(a)passcrypt``, ``(a)seeder``, ``(a)time_safe_equality``,
      ``Datastream``, ``bits``, ``(a)seedrange``, ``(a)build_tree``,
      ``(a)customize_parameters``, ``convert_class_method_to_member``,
      ``convert_static_method_to_member``, ``(a)xor``, ``(a)padding_key``,
      ``(a)prime_table``, ``(a)unique_range_gen``, ``(a)non_0_digits``,
      ``(a)bytes_digits``, ``(a)digits``, ``(a)permute``, ``(a)shuffle``,
      ``(a)unshuffle``, ``(a)create_namespace``, ``(a)time_safe_equality``,
      (``(a)depad_plaintext``, ``(a)pad_plaintext`` & their generator forms.
      Only the non-generator forms remain in the ``Padding`` class), (The
      ``(a)passcrypt``, ``(a)uuids``, ``(a)into_namespace`` methods from the
      database classes), (The ``(a)csprbg`` functions were removed & instead
      the ``(a)csprng`` functions produce ``bytes`` type values.)
   
-  Thorough & deep refactorings of modules, classes & methods. Many methods
   & functions were made private, cleaning up the APIs of the package,
   focusing on bringing the highest-level functionalities to top level
   namespaces accessible to users. Some purely private functionalities
   were entirely moved to private namespaces not readily accessible to
   users.
-  Most of the constants which determine the functionalities throughout
   the package were refactored out into the ``commons.py``. This allows
   for easy changes to protocols & data formats.


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Many documentation improvements, fixes, trimmings & updates.
-  Added a ``WeakEntropy`` class to the ``randoms.py`` module.




Changes for version 0.19.4 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Created a private ``EntropyDaemon`` class to run a thread in the 
   background which feeds into & extracts entropy from some of the 
   package's entropy pools. Also moved the separate private ``_cache`` 
   entropy pools from the parameters to the random number generators. 
   They're now a single private ``_pool`` shared global that's 
   asynchronously & continuously updated by the background daemon thread. 
-  Switched the ``random`` portion of function names in the ``randoms.py`` 
   module to read ``unique`` instead. This was done to the functions which 
   are actually pseudo-random. This should give users a better idea of 
   which functions do what. The exception is that the ``random_sleep`` & 
   ``arandom_sleep`` functions have kept their names even though they 
   sleep a pseudo-randomly variable amount of time. Their names may 
   cause more confusion if they were either ``(a)unique_sleep`` or 
   ``(a)urandom_sleep``. Because they don't use ``os.urandom`` & what 
   is a ``unique_sleep``? When / if a better name is found these 
   function names will be updated as well. 


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various docstring / documentation fixes & refactorings.




Changes for version 0.19.3 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Removed ``ascii_encipher``, ``ascii_decipher``, ``aascii_encipher`` &
   ``aascii_decipher`` generators from the ``Chunky2048`` & ``Comprende``
   classes, & the package. It was unnecessary, didn't fit well with the
   intended use of the ``Padding`` class, & users would be much better
   served by converting their ascii to bytes to use the ``bytes_``
   generators instead.
-  Removed the ``map_encipher``, ``map_decipher``, ``amap_encipher`` &
   ``amap_decipher`` generators from the ``Chunky2048`` & ``Comprende``
   classes, & the package. They were not being used internally to the 
   package anymore, & their functionality, security & efficiency could 
   not be guaranteed to track well with the changes in the rest of the 
   library.
-  Added domain specificity to the ``X25519`` protocols' key derivations.
-  Renamed the database classes' ``(a)encrypt`` & ``(a)decrypt`` methods
   to ``(a)json_encrypt`` & ``(a)json_decrypt`` for clarity & consistency
   with the rest of the package. Their signatures, as well as those in 
   ``(a)bytes_encrypt`` & ``(a)bytes_decrypt``, were also altered to
   receive plaintext & ciphertext as their only positional arguments. 
   The ``filename`` argument is now a keyword-only argument with a default
   ``None`` value. This allows databases to be used more succinctly for
   manual encryption & decryption by making the filename tweak optional.
-  The ``runs`` keyword argument for the functions in ``randoms.py`` was
   renamed to ``rounds``. It seems more clear that it is controlling the
   number of rounds are internally run within the ``(a)random_number_generator``
   functions when deriving new entropy. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Fixes to docstrings & tutorials. Rewrite & reorganization of the 
   ``PREADME.rst`` & ``README.rst``. More updates to the readme's are still
   on the way.
-  Slight fix to the Passcrypt docstring's algorithm diagram.
-  Moved the default passcrypt settings to variables in the ``Passcrypt``
   class.
-  Added the ability to send passcrypt settings into the ``mnemonic`` &
   ``amnemonic`` coroutines, which call the algorithm internally but 
   previously could only use the default settings.
-  Some code cleanups & refactorings.




Changes for version 0.19.2 
-------------------------- 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Made the output lengths of the ``Padding`` class' generator functions 
   uniform. When the footer padding on a stream of plaintext needs to 
   exceed the 256-byte blocksize (i.e. when the last unpadded plaintext 
   block's length ``L`` is ``232 < L < 256``), then another full block of
   padding is produced. The generators now yield 256-byte blocks 
   consistently (except during depadding when the last block of plaintext
   may be smaller than the blocksize), instead of sometimes producing a
   final padded block which is 512 bytes.




Changes for version 0.19.1 
-------------------------- 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Fixed a bug where database classes were evaluating as falsey when they
   didn't have any tags saved in them. They should be considered truthy 
   if they're instantiated & ready to store data, even if they're 
   currently empty & not saved to disk. This was reflected in their 
   ``__bool__`` methods. The bug caused empty metatags not to be loaded 
   when an instance loads, even when ``preload`` is toggled ``True``.
-  Removed the coroutine-receiving logic from the ``Padding`` class'
   ``Comprende`` generators. Since they buffer data, the received values
   aren't ever going to coincide with the correct iteration & will be
   susceptible to bugs
-  Fixed a bug in the ``Padding`` class' ``Comprende`` generators which 
   cut iteration short because not enough data was available from the 
   underlying generators upfront. Now, if used correctly to pad/depad 
   chunks of plaintext 256 bytes at a time, then they work as expected.
-  The ``update``, ``aupdate``, ``update_key`` & ``aupdate_key`` methods
   in both the ``StreamHMAC`` & ``DomainKDF`` classes now return ``self``
   to allow inline updates.
-  Added ``acsprng`` & ``csprng`` function pointers to the ``Chunky2048``
   class.
-  Updates to docstrings which didn't get updated with info on the new 
   *synthetic IV* feature.
-  Some other docstring fixes.
-  Some small code cleanups & refactorings.




Changes for version 0.19.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Upgrade: The package's cipher was changed to an online, 
   authenticated scheme with salt reuse / misuse resistance. This was 
   acheived through a few backwards incompatible techniques: 
   
   1. A synthetic IV (SIV) is calculated from the keyed-hash of the first 
      256-byte block of plaintext. The SIV is then used to seed the 
      keystream generator, & is used to update the validator object. This 
      ensures that if the first block is unique, then the whole ciphertext 
      will be unique.
   2. A 16-byte ephemeral & random SIV-key is also prepended to the 
      first block of plaintext during message padding. Since this value 
      is also hashed to derive the SIV, this key gives a strong 
      guarantee that a given message will produce a globally unique 
      ciphertext.
   3. An 8-byte timestamp is prepended to the first block of plaintext 
      during padding. Timestamps are inherently sequential, they can be 
      verified by a user within some bounds, & can also be used to 
      mitigate replay attacks. Since it's hashed to make the SIV, then 
      it helps make the entire ciphertext unique.
   4. After being updated with each block of ciphertext, the validator's 
      current state is again fed into the keystream generator as a new 
      rotating seed. This mitigation is limited to ensuring only that 
      every following block of ciphertext to a block which is unique
      will also be unique. More specifically this means that: **if** 
      *all* **other mitigations fail to be unique**, or are missing, then 
      the first block which is unique **will appear the same**, except 
      for the bits which have changed, **but, all following blocks will
      be randomized.** This limitation could be avoided with a linear
      expansion in the ciphertext size by generating an SIV for each
      block of plaintext. This linear expansion is prohibitive as a
      default setting, but the block level secrecy, even when all other 
      mitigations fail, is enticing. This option may be added in the 
      future as a type of padding mode on the plaintext.
   
   The SIV-key is by far the most important mitigation, as it isn't 
   feasibly forgeable by an adversary, & therefore also protects against
   attacks using encryption oracles. These changes can be found in the 
   ``SyntheticIV`` class, the (en/de)cipher & xor generators, & the 
   ``StreamHMAC`` class in the ``ciphers.py`` module. The padding 
   changes can also be found in the new ``Padding`` class in the ``generics.py`` 
   module. The SIV is attached in the clear with ciphertexts & was 
   designed to function with minimal user interaction. It needs only to 
   be passed into the ``StreamHMAC`` class during decryption -- during 
   encryption it's automatically generated & stored in the ``StreamHMAC`` 
   validator object's ``siv`` property attribute. 
-  Security Patch: The internal ``sha3_512`` kdf's to the  ``akeys``, ``keys``, 
   ``abytes_keys`` & ``bytes_keys`` keystream generators are now updated
   with 72 bytes of (64 key material + 8 padding), instead of just 64 
   bytes of key material. 72 bytes is the *bitrate* of the ``sha3_512`` 
   object. This change causes the internal state of the object to be permuted 
   for each iteration update & before releasing a chunk of key material. 
   Frequency analysis of ciphertext bytes didn't smooth out to the 
   cumulative distribution expected for all large ciphertexts prior to 
   this change. But after the change the distribution does normalize as
   expected. This indicates that the key material streams were biased 
   away from random in a small but measurable way. Although, no 
   particular byte values seem to have been preferred by this bias, this 
   is a huge shortcoming with unknown potential impact on the strength 
   of the package's cipher. This update is strongly recommended & is 
   backwards incompatible. 
-  This update gives a name to the package's pseudo-one-time-pad cipher 
   implementation. It's now called ``Chunky2048``! The ``OneTimePad`` 
   class' name was updated to ``Chunky2048`` to match the change.
-  The ``PreemptiveHMACValidation`` class & its related logic in the
   ``StreamHMAC`` class was removed. The chaining of validator output
   into the keystream makes running the validator over the ciphertext 
   separately or prior to the decryption process very costly. It would 
   either mean recalculating the full hash of the ciphertext a second 
   time to reproduce the correct outputs during each block, or a large 
   linear memory increase to hold all of its digests to be fed in some 
   time after preemtive validation. It's much simpler to remove that 
   functionality & potentially replace it with something else that fits
   the user's applications better. For instance, the ``current_digest``
   & ``acurrent_digest`` methods can produce secure, 32-byte authentication
   tags at any arbitrary blocks throughout the cipher's runtime, which
   validate the cipehrtext up to that point. Or, the ``next_block_id`` 
   & ``anext_block_id`` methods, which are a more robust option because 
   each id they produce validates the next ciphertext block before 
   updating the internal state of the validator. This acts as an 
   automatic message ordering algorithm, & leaves the deciphering 
   party's state unharmed by dropped packets or manipulated ciphertext.
-  The ``update_key`` & ``aupdate_key`` methods were also added to the
   ``StreamHMAC`` class. They allow the user to update the validators'
   internal key with new entropy or context information during its 
   runtime. 
-  The ``Comprende`` class now takes a ``chained`` keyword-only argument
   which flags an instance as a chained generator. This flag allows 
   instances to communicate up & down their generator chain using the 
   shared ``Namespace`` object accessible by their ``messages`` attribute.
-  The chainable ``Comprende`` generator functions had their internals
   altered to allow them to receive, & pass down their chain, values 
   sent from a user using the standard coroutine ``send`` & ``asend``
   method syntax.
-  ``Comprende`` instances no longer automatically reset themselves every 
   time they enter their context managers or when they are iterated over.
   This makes their interface more closely immitate the behavior of 
   async/sync generator objects. To get them to reset, the ``areset`` or 
   ``reset`` methods must be used. The message chaining introduced in 
   this update allows chains of ``Comprende`` async/sync generators to 
   inform each other when the user instructs one of them to reset.
-  The standard library's ``hmac`` module is now used internally to the
   ``generics.py`` module's ``sha_512_hmac``, ``sha_256_hmac``, ``asha_512_hmac`` 
   & ``asha_256_hmac`` functions. They still allow any type of data to be 
   hashed, but also now default to hashing ``bytes`` type objects as 
   they are given.
-  The new ``Domains`` class, found in ``generics.py``, is now used to
   encode constants into deterministic pseudo-random 8-byte values for
   helping turn hash function outputs into domain-specific hashes. Its
   use was included throughout the library. This method has an added
   benefit with respect to this package's usage of SHA-3. That being, the
   *bitrate* for both ``sha3_512`` & ``sha3_256`` are ``(2 * 32 * k) + 8``
   bytes, where ``k = 1`` for ``sha3_512`` & ``k = 2`` for ``sha3_256``.
   This means that prepending an 8-byte domain string to their inputs
   also makes it more efficient to add some multiple of key material
   to make the input data precisely equal the *bitrate*. More info on
   domain-specific hashing can be found here_.

.. _here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/241.pdf

-  A new ``DomainsKDF`` class in ``cipehrs.py`` was added to create a
   more standard & secure method of key derivation to the library which 
   also incorporates domain separation. Its use was integrated thoughout 
   the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes to mitigate any further 
   vulnerabilities of their internal key-derivation functions. The 
   database classes now also use bytes-type keys internally, instead 
   of hex strings.
-  The ``Passcrypt`` class now contains methods which create & validate
   passcrypt hashes which have their settings & salt attached to them.
   Instances can now also be created with persistent settings that are 
   automatically sent into instance methods.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Many fixes of docstrings, typos & tutorials. 
-  Many refactorings: name changes, extracted classes / functions, 
   reorderings & moves. 
-  Various code clean-ups, efficiency & usability improvements.
-  Many constants used throughout the library were given names defined 
   in the ``commons.py`` module.
-  Removed extraneous functions throughout the library.
-  The asymmetric key generation & exchange functions/protocols were 
   moved from the ``ciphers.py`` module to ``keygens.py``.
-  Add missing modules to the MANIFEST.rst file. 
-  Added a ``UniformPrimes`` class to the ``__datasets`` module for efficient 
   access to primes that aren't either mostly 1 or 0 bits, as is the case for 
   the ``primes`` helper table. These primes are now used in the ``Hasher`` 
   class' ``amask_byte_order`` & ``mask_byte_order`` methods. 
-  The ``time_safe_equality`` & ``atime_safe_equality`` methods are now 
   standalone functions available from the ``generics.py`` module.
-  Added ``reset_pool`` to the ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` classes. Also
   fixed a missing piece of logic in their ``submit`` method.
-  Added various conversion values & timing functions to the ``asynchs.py``
   module.
-  The ``make_uuid`` & ``amake_uuid`` coroutines had their names changed to 
   ``make_uuids`` & ``amake_uuids``.
-  Created a new ``Datastream`` class in ``generics.py`` to handle buffering
   & resizing iterable streams of data. It enables simplifying logic that 
   must happen some number of iterations before the end of a stream. It's 
   utilized in the ``Padding`` class' generator functions available as 
   chainable ``Comprende`` methods.
-  The ``data`` & ``adata`` generators can now produce a precise number of
   ``size``-length ``blocks`` as specified by a user. This gets rid of the
   confusing usage of the old ``stop`` keyword-only argument, which stopped 
   a stream after *approximately* ``size`` number of elements.
-  Improved the efficiency & safety of entropy production in the 
   ``randoms.py`` module.



Changes for version 0.18.1 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Patch: Deprecated & replaced an internal kdf for saving 
   database tags due to a vulnerability. If an adversary can get a user 
   to reveal the value returned by the ``hmac`` method when fed the tag 
   file's filename & the salt used for that encrypted tag, then they 
   could deduce the decryption key for the tag. A version check was 
   added only for backwards compatibility & will be removed on the next 
   update. All databases should continue functioning as normal, though 
   all users are advised to **re-save their databases** after upgrading
   so the new kdf can be used. This will not overwrite the old files,
   so they'll need to be deleted manually.
-  Replaced usage of the async ``switch`` coroutine with ``asyncio.sleep``
   because it was not allowing tasks to switch as it was designed to.
   Many improvements were made related to this change to make the
   package behave better in async contexts.
-  Removed the private method in the database classes which held a 
   reference to the root salt. It's now held in a private attribute. 
   This change simplifies the code a bit & allows instances to be 
   pickleable.
-  The ``atimeout`` & ``timeout`` chainable ``Comprende`` generator
   methods can now stop the generators' executions mid-iteration. They
   run them in separate async tasks or thread pools, respectively, to 
   acheive this.
-  The ``await_on`` & ``wait_on`` generators now restart their timeout
   counters after every successful iteration that detected a new value
   in their ``queue``. The ``delay`` keyword argument was changed to 
   ``probe_frequency``, a keyword-only argument.
-  Removed the package's dependency on the ``aioitertools`` package.
-  Made the ``sympy`` package an optional import. If any of its
   functionalities are used by the user, the package is only then
   imported & this is done automatically.
-  Various streamlining efforts were made to the imports & entropy
   initialization to reduce the package's import & startup time.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Fixes of various typos, docstrings & tutorials.
-  Various cleanups, refactorings & efficiency improvements.
-  Added new tests for detecting malformed or modified ciphertexts.
-  Removed extraneous functions in ``generics.py``.
-  Add a ``UNIFORM_PRIME_512`` value to ``__datasets.py`` for use in the 
   ``Hasher.mask_byte_order`` & ``Hasher.amask_byte_order`` methods.
   Those methods were also altered to produce more uniform looking 
   results. The returned masked values are now also 64 bytes by default.
-  Added an ``automate_key_use`` keyword-only boolean argument to the init
   for the ``OneTimePad``, ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` classes. It can be toggled to
   stop the classes from overwriting class methods so they 
   automatically read the instance's key attribute. This optionally 
   speeds up instantiation by an order of magnitude at the cost of 
   convenience.
-  Fixed ``asynchs.Threads`` class' wrongful use of a ``multiprocessing``
   ``Manager.list`` object instead of a regular list.
-  Changed the ``_delay`` keyword-only argument in ``Processes`` & ``Threads``
   classes' methods to ``probe_freqeuncy`` so users can specify how often
   results will be checked for after firing off a process, thread, or
   associated pool submission.
-  Now the ``asubmit`` & ``submit`` methods in ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` 
   can accept keyword arguments.
-  Added ``agather`` & ``gather`` methods to the ``Threads`` & ``Processes``
   classes. They receive any number of functions, & ``args`` &/or ``kwargs`` to
   pass to those functions when submitting them to their associated 
   pools.
-  Changed the ``runsum`` instance IDs from hex strings to bytes & cleaned 
   up the instance caching & cleaning logic.
-  Altered & made private the ``asalted_multiply`` & ``salted_multiply``
   functions in the ``randoms.py`` module.
-  Started a new event loop specific to the ``randoms.py`` module which
   should prevent the ``RuntimeError`` when ``random_number_generator``
   is called from within the user's running event loop.
-  Added a ``ValueError`` check to the ``(a)cspr(b/n)g`` functions in 
   ``randoms.py``. This will allow simultaneously running tasks to 
   request entropy from the function by returning a result from a 
   newly instantiated generator object. 
-  Added checks in the ``*_encipher`` & ``*_decipher`` generators to 
   help assure users correctly declare the mode for their StreamHMAC 
   validator instances. 
-  Fixed the ``__len__`` function in the database classes to count the 
   number of tags in the database & exclude their internal maintenaince 
   files.
-  The ``TimeoutError`` raised after decrypting a ciphertext with an 
   expired timestamp now contains the seconds it has exceeded the ``ttl``
   in a ``value`` attribute.
-  The timestamp used to sign the package now displays the day of 
   signing instead of the second of signing.
-  The ``(a)sum_sha_*`` & ``(a)sum_passcrypt`` generators were altered to
   reapply the supplied ``salt`` on every iteration. 
-  Stabilized the usability of the ``stop`` keyword-only argument in the
   ``adata`` & ``data`` generators. It now directly decides the total
   number of elements in a ``sequence`` allowed to be yielded.




Changes for version 0.18.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Patch: Rewrote the HMAC-like creation & authentication 
   process for all of the package's ciphers. Now, the ``*_encipher``
   & ``*_decipher`` ``Comprende`` generators must be passed a validator
   object to hash the ciphertext as it's being created / decrypted.
   The ``StreamHMAC`` class was created for this purpose. It's initalized
   with the user's long-term key, the ephemeral salt & the pid value.
   The pid value can now effectively be used to validate additional data.
   These changes force the package's cipher to be used as an AEAD cipher.
-  Security Patch: The package's ``*_hmac`` hash functions & the ``Comprende``
   class' hash generators were rewritten to prepend salts & keys to data
   prior to hashing instead of appending. This is better for several 
   important reasons, such as: reducing the amortizability of costs in
   trying to brute-force hashes, & more closely following the reasoning
   behind the HMAC spec even though sha3 has a different security profile. 
-  Algorithm Patch: The ``akeys``, ``keys``, ``abytes_keys``, & ``bytes_keys``
   algorithms have been patched to differentiate each iteration's two
   sha3_512 hashes from one another in perpetuity. They contained a design
   flaw which would, if both sha3_512 objects landed upon the same 
   1600-bit internal state, then they would produce the same keystreams 
   from then on. This change in backwards incompatible. This flaw is 
   infeasible to exploit in practice, but since the package's hashes & 
   ciphertext validations were already channging this release, there was 
   no reason to not fix this flaw so that it's self-healing if they ever 
   do land on the same internal states.
-  The ``Passcrypt`` class & its algorithm were made more efficient to
   better equalize the cost for users & adversaries & simplifies the
   algorithm. Any inefficiencies in an implementation would likely cause
   the adversary to be able to construct optimized implementations to 
   put users at an even greater disadvantage at protecting their inputs
   to the passcrypt algorithm. It used the ``sum_sha_256`` hash function 
   internally, & since it was also changing in a non-backwards 
   compatible way with this update, it was the best time to clean up
   the implementation.
-  Updated the package's description & its docstrings that refer to 
   the package's cipher as an implementation of the one-time-pad. It's 
   not accurate since the package uses pseudo-random hash functions to 
   produce key material. Instead, the package's goal is to create a 
   pseudo-one-time-pad that's indistinguishable from a one-time-pad.
   The ``OneTimePad`` class will keep its name for succinctness. 
-  New ``amake_token``, ``make_token``, ``aread_token`` & ``read_token``
   class & instance methods added to the ``OneTimePad`` class. These
   tokens are urlsafe base64 encoded, are encrypted, authenticated &
   contain timestamps that can enforce a time-to-live for each token.
-  Non-backwards compatible changes to the database classes' filenames,
   encryption keys & HMACs. The ``*_hmac`` hash functions that the 
   databases rely on were changing with this update, so additionally the 
   filenames table used to encode the filenames was switched from the 
   ``BASE_36_TABLE`` to the ``BASE_38_TABLE``. Both tables are safe for 
   uri's across all platforms, but the new table can encode information 
   slightly more efficiently.
-  Major refactorings & signature changes across the package to make
   passing keys & salts to ``*_hmac`` functions & the ``Comprende`` 
   class' hash generators explicit.
-  Removed the ``of`` keyword argument from all of the ``Comprende`` 
   class' generators. It was overly complicating the code, & was not
   entirely clear or useful for settings outside of the ``tags`` & 
   ``atags`` generators.
-  Removed ``pybase64`` from the package & its dependencies list. The
   built-in python ``base64`` module works just fine.
-  Sorted the ``WORDS_LIST``, ``ASCII_ALPHANUMERIC``, & ``BASE_64_TABLE``
   datasets.
-  The ``salt`` & ``asalt`` functions have been renamed to ``generate_salt``
   & ``agenerate_salt`` for clarity's sake, & to reduce naming 
   collisions.
-  Added another redundancy to the ``arandom_number_generator`` &
   ``random_number_generator`` functions. Now the async tasks it prepares
   into a list are pseudo-randomly shuffled before being passed into 
   ``asyncio.gather``.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added a logo image to the package.
-  Separated the FAQ section from ``PREADME.rst``.
-  The ``primes`` & ``bits`` datasets are now represented in hex in the
   source code.
-  Added a ``BASE_38_TABLE`` dataset to the package.
-  The database classes now fill an ephemeral dictionary of filenames
   that couldn't be used to successfully load a tag file, available from 
   within the ``_corrupted_files`` attribute.
-  The ``Comprende`` class' ``acache_check`` & ``cache_check`` context
   manager methods are now called ``aauto_cache`` & ``auto_cache``.
-  Added new ``bytes_count`` & ``abytes_count`` generators to ``generics.py``
   module which increment each iteration & yield the results as bytes.
-  Removed the ``akeypair`` & ``keypair`` functions from the package. 
   Their successors are the ``asingle_use_key`` & ``single_use_key`` methods
   in the ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes. The attempt is to clarify &
   put constraints on the interface for creating a bundle of key 
   material that has a single-use-only salt attached, as well as the pid 
   value. 
-  Moved ciphertext encoding functions into the ``BytesIO`` class from
   the global ``generics.py`` module.
-  Split ``PrimeGroups`` into two classes, one higher-level class by the
   same name & a ``BasePrimeGroups`` class. The former also has some
   added functionality for masking the order of bytes in a sequence 
   using an modular exponentiation.
-  The ``Hasher`` class now has functionality added to mask the order
   of a bytes sequence with a modular multiplication.
-  Fixed the name of the project in the attribution lines in several 
   source files.
-  Reconciled tests with the major changes in this release.
-  The old identity key for the package that was signed by the gnupg 
   identity key was shredded & replaced with a new signed key.
-  Several bug fixes to the ``setup.py`` automated code signing.




Changes for version 0.17.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Patch: The HMAC verifiers on ciphertexts did not include 
   the ``salt`` or ``pid`` values when deriving the HMAC. This 
   associated data can therefore be changed to cause a party to
   decrypt a past ciphertext with a salt or pid of an attacker's
   choosing. This is a critical vulnerability & it is highly recommended
   all users update. The fix is to hash the ciphertext, ``salt`` 
   & ``pid`` together & sending that hash into the validator to have
   the HMAC created / tested. This change will cause all prior 
   ciphertexts to be marked invalid by the validator.
-  Refactored the names of the Comprende cipher methods to better 
   communicate their intended use as lower level tools that cannot be
   used on their own to obtain authenticated, CCA or CPA secure 
   encryption.
-  Added more comprehensive tests for ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes,
   as well as the protocols that utilize the ``X25519`` ecdh exchange.
   Fixed some bugs in the process.
-  ``X25519`` instances that contain a secret key now have access to
   protocol methods which automatically pass their key in as a keyword
   argument. This simplifies their usage further.
-  Incorporated the new ``Hasher`` class into the package's random
   number generator to improve its entropy production.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various fixes to typos, docstrings & tutorials.
-  New tutorials & docs added.
-  Changed the default table in ``ByteIO`` 's ``json_to_ascii``, ``ajson_to_ascii``,
   ``ascii_to_json`` & ``aascii_to_json`` to the ``URL_SAFE_TABLE`` to 
   facilitate the creation of urlsafe_tokens.
-  Removed all code in the ``Ropake`` class that was used to create a default
   database to store a default salt for users. All of that functionality 
   is expected to be handled by the database classes' token & profile 
   creation tools.
-  Fixed bug in package signing script that called hex from a string.
-  Updated the package signing script to include these metadata in the
   signatures of the ephemeral keys: name of the package, version, the 
   date in seconds.
-  Added metadata to the ``setup.cfg`` file.
-  Make passcrypt objects available from the ``keygens`` module.
-  Add more consistent ability within ``Ropake`` class to specify a
   time-to-live for protocol messages.
-  Added check to make sure instances of ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` are
   not trying to import a new secret key once they already have one. 
   This won't be allowed in favor of creating a new object for a new
   secret key.
-  Fixed bug in database classes' bytes ciphers which called themselves
   recursively instead of calling the global functions of the same name.




Changes for version 0.16.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  All ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` filenames have been converted to
   base36 to aid in making the manifest files & the databases as a whole 
   more space efficient. These changes are not backwards compatible.
-  More work was done to clean up the databases & make them more 
   efficient, as well as equalize the sizes of the database files to
   mitigate leaking metadata about what they might contain. 
-  Added new ``X25519`` & ``Ed25519`` classes that greatly simplify the
   usage of the cryptography module's 25519 based tools. They also help
   organize the codebase better -- where ``Ropake`` was holding onto
   all of the asymmetric tooling even though those tools were not part
   of the Ropake protocol.
-  New base & helper ``Asymmetric25519`` & ``BaseEllipticCurve`` classes 
   were added as well to facilitate the reorganization.
-  Many methods in ``Ropake`` were turned private to simplify & clean up 
   the interface so its intended use as a protocol is more clear for users.
-  Added the time-to-live functionality to ``Ropake`` decryption functions.
   The ``TIMEOUT`` attribute on the class can also be changed to import 
   a global time-to-live for all ``Ropake`` ciphertexts.
-  Removed all ``nc_`` hash functions from the package/generics.py module.
-  The ``Namespace`` class now has a ``keys`` method so that namespaces
   can be unpacked using star-star syntax.
-  Because of the ongoing failures of gnupg, we are moving away from 
   signing our packages with gnupg. Our new Ed25519 keys will be from
   the cryptography package, & we'll sign those with our gnupg key as a
   secondary form of attestation. Our package signing will be automated
   in the setup.py file & the methods we use will be transparent in the 
   code. The new signatures for each package version will be placed in 
   the file ``SIGNATURES.txt``.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Many fixes & additions to docstrings & tutorials.
-  Massive refactorings, cleanups & typo fixes across the library, 
   especially in the database classes, ``Ropake`` & the ``ciphers`` module.
-  Added comprehensive functional tests for the Ropake class.
-  Added ``BASE_36_TABLE`` to the ``commons`` module.
-  Fixed metadata issues in setup.py that caused upload issues to pypi.
-  The ``generate_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``agenerate_profile`` &
   ``aload_profile`` database methods now accept arbitrary keyword arguments 
   that get passed into the database's __init__ constructor.
-  ``username`` & ``password`` are now required keyword-only arguments
   to the ``agenerate_profile_tokens`` & ``generate_profile_tokens`` 
   classmethods.
-  The ``aload`` & ``load`` database methods now take a ``manifest`` kwarg
   that when toggled ``True`` will also refresh the manifest file from 
   disk.
-  Now when a database object is ordered to delete itself, the entirety 
   of the instance's caches & attribute values are cleared & deleted.
-  Filled out the references to strong key generators & protocols in the
   ``keygens`` module.




Changes for version 0.15.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Patch: The previous update left the default salt stored by
   the ``Ropake`` class on the user filesystem as an empty string  for
   new files that were created since the ``asalt`` & ``salt`` functions
   were switched to producing 256-bit values instead of 512-bits. This
   bug has now been fixed.
-  An 8 byte timestamp is now prepended to each plaintext during the
   padding step. The decryption functions now take a ``ttl`` kwarg which
   will measure & enforce a time-to-live for ciphertexts under threat of
   ``TimeoutError``.
-  Added new profile feature to the database classes. This standardizes
   & simplifies the process for users to open databases using only 
   low-entropy "profile" information such as ``username``, ``password``,
   ``*credentials`` & an optional ``salt`` a user may have access to. 
   The new ``agenerate_profile_tokens``, ``generate_profile_tokens``, 
   ``agenerate_profile``, ``generate_profile``, ``aprofile_exists``, 
   ``profile_exists``, ``aload_profile``, ``load_profile``, ``adelete_profile``
   & ``delete_profile`` functions are the public part of this new feature.
-  Some more database class attributes have been turned private to clean
   up the api.
-  Fixed typo in ``__exit__`` method of ``Database`` class which referenced 
   a method which had its name refactored, leading to a crash.
-  Shifted the values in the ``primes`` dictionary such that the key for
   each element in the dictionary is the exclusive maximum of each prime
   in that element. Ex: primes[512][-1].to_bytes(64, "big") is now valid.
   Whereas before, primes[512] was filled with primes that were 64 bytes
   and 1 bit long, making them 65 byte primes. This changes some of the
   values of constants in the package & therefore some values derived 
   from those constants.
-  Slimmed down the number of elements in the ``primes`` & ``bits`` 
   dictionaries, reducing the size of the package a great deal. ``primes``
   now contains two primes in each element, the first is the minimum 
   prime of that bit length, the latter the maximum.
-  Added ``URLSAFE_TABLE`` to the package.
-  Made ``salt`` & ``pid`` & ``ttl`` keyword only arguments in key 
   generators & encryption / decryption functions, further tighening up
   the api.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added ``this_second`` function to ``asynchs`` module for integer time.
-  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & 
   ``plaintext_stream`` functions to the ``ciphers`` module.
-  Added ``apadding_key``, ``padding_key`` to the ``keygens`` module &
   ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes.
-  Added ``axi_mix``, ``xi_mix``, ``acheck_timestamp``, ``check_timestamp``,
   to the ``generics`` module.
-  Added ``acsprbg``, ``csprbg``, ``asalt``, ``salt``, ``apadding_key``, 
   ``padding_key``, ``aplaintext_stream`` & ``plaintext_stream`` functions
   to OneTimePad class as ``staticmethod`` & instance methods.
-  Added ``acheck_timestamp`` & ``check_timestamp`` functions to the 
   ``BytesIO`` class.
-  Added ``adeniable_filename`` & ``deniable_filename`` to the ``paths`` 
   module. 
-  Removed check for falsey data in encryption functions. Empty data is 
   & should be treated as valid plaintext.
-  Various refactorings, docstring fixes & efficiency improvements.
-  Added some new tests for database profiles.




Changes for version 0.14.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security patch: The ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` &
   ``depad_bytes`` functions were changed internally to execute in a
   more constant time. The variations were small for 256-byte buffers
   (the default), but can grow very wide with larger buffers. The salt
   in the package's encryption utilities is now used to derive the 
   plaintext's padding, making each padding unique. 
-  Unified the types of encodings the library's encryption functions
   utilize for producing ciphertext. This includes databases. They now
   all use the ``LIST_ENCODING``. This greatly increases the efficiency
   of the databases' encryption/decryption, save/load times. And this
   encoding is more space efficient. This change is backwards
   incompatible.
-  The ``LIST_ENCODING`` specification was also changed to produce
   smaller ciphertexts. The salt is no longer encrypted & included as
   the first 256 byte chunk of ciphertext. It is now packaged along with
   ciphertext in the clear & is restricted to being a 256-bit hex
   string.
-  The interfaces for the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` were cleaned
   up. Many attributes & functions that were not intended as the public
   interface of the classes were made "private". Also, the no longer
   used utilities for encrypting & decrypting under the MAP_ENCODING
   were removed.
-  Updated the ``abytes_xor``, ``bytes_xor``, ``axor`` & ``xor`` generators 
   to shrink the size of the ``seed`` that's fed into the ``keystream``. This
   allows the one-time-pad cipher to be more cpu efficient.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Fixed various typos, docstrings & tutorials that have no kept up
   with the pace of changes.
-  Various refactorings throughout.
-  The ``akeypair`` & ``keypair`` functions now produce a ``Namespace``
   populated with a 512-bit hex key & a 256-bit hex salt to be more
   consistent with their intended use-case with the one-time-pad cipher.
-  Removed ``aencode_salt``, ``encode_salt``, ``adecode_salt`` & 
   ``decode_salt`` functions since they are no longer used in conjunction
   with LIST_ENCODING ciphertexts.
-  Updated tests to recognize these changes.
-  Gave the ``OneTimePad`` class access to a ``BytesIO`` object under a
   new ``io`` attribute.




Changes for version 0.13.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Security Patch: ``xor`` & ``axor`` functions that define the 
   one-time-pad cipher had a vulnerability fixed that can leak <1-bit of
   plaintext. The issue was in the way keys were built, where the
   multiplicative products of two key segments were xor'd together. This
   lead to keys being slightly more likely to be positive integers, 
   meaning the final bit had a greater than 1/2 probability of being a 
   ``0``. The fix is accompanied with an overhaul of the one-time-pad 
   cipher which is more efficient, faster, & designed with a better 
   understanding of the way bytes are processed & represented. The key
   chunks now do not, & must not, surpass 256 bytes & neither should 
   any chunk of plaintext output. Making each chunk deterministically 
   256 bytes allows for reversibly formatting ciphertext to & from 
   bytes-like strings. These changes are backwards incompatible with 
   prior versions of this package & are strongly recommended.
-  Added ``bytes_xor`` & ``abytes_xor`` functions which take in key 
   generators which produce key segments of type bytes instead of hex 
   strings.
-  ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now save files in bytes format,
   making them much more efficient on disk space. They use the new
   ``BytesIO`` class in the ``generics`` module to transparently convert
   to & from json & bytes. This change is also not backwards compatible.
-  Removed ``acipher``, ``cipher``, ``adecipher``, ``decipher``,
   ``aorganize_encryption_streams``, ``organize_encryption_streams``,
   ``aorganize_decryption_streams``, ``organize_decryption_streams``,
   ``aencrypt``, ``encrypt``, ``adecrypt``, ``decrypt``, ``asubkeys`` &
   ``subkeys`` generators from the ``ciphers`` module & package to slim 
   down the code, remove repetition & focus on the cipher tools that 
   include hmac authentication.
-  Removed deprecated diffie-hellman methods in ``Ropake`` class. 
-  Removed the static ``power10`` dictionary from the package.
-  The default secret salt for the ``Ropake`` class is now derived from the 
   contents of a file that's in the databases directory which is chmod'd to 
   0o000 unless needed. 
-  Made ``aclient_message_key``, ``client_message_key``, ``aserver_message_key``, 
   & ``server_message_key`` ``Ropake`` class methods to help distinguish 
   client-to-server & server-to-client message keys which prevents replay 
   attacks on the one-message ROPAKE protocol. 
-  Added protocol coroutines to the ``Ropake`` class which allow for easily
   engaging in 2DH & 3DH elliptic curve exchanges for servers & clients.
-  Efficiency improvements to the ``aseeder`` & ``seeder`` generator functions
   in the ``randoms`` module. This affects the ``acsprng`` & ``csprng`` objects
   & all the areas in the library that utilize those objects.
-  Changed the repr behavior of ``Comprende`` instances to redact all args &
   kwargs by default to protect cryptographic material from unintentionally
   being displayed on user systems. The repr can display full contents by 
   calling the ``enable_debugging`` method of the ``DebugControl`` class.
-  All generator functions decorated with ``comprehension`` are now given
   a ``root`` attribute. This allows direct access to the function without
   needing to instantiate or run it as a ``Comprende`` object. This saves 
   a good deal of cpu & time in the overhead that would otherwise be 
   incurred by the class. This is specifically more helpful in tight &/or
   lower-level looping.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various refactorings across the library. 
-  Fixed various typos, bugs & inaccurate docstrings throughout the library.
-  Add ``chown`` & ``chmod`` functions to the ``asynchs.aos`` module. 
-  Now makes new ``multiprocessing.Manager`` objects in the ``asynchs.Processes`` 
   & ``asynchs.Threads`` classes to avoid errors that occur when using a stale 
   object whose socket connections are closed. 
-  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``adb_login`` & ``db_login`` methods to 
   ``adatabase_login_key`` & ``database_login_key``. Also, fix a crash bug in 
   those methods. 
-  Changed ``Ropake`` class' ``aec25519_pub``, ``ec25519_pub``, ``aec25519_priv`` 
   & ``ec25519_priv`` methods to ``aec25519_public_bytes``, ``ec25519_public_bytes``, 
   ``aec25519_private_bytes`` & ``ec25519_private_bytes``. 
-  Added low-level private methods to ``Ropake`` class which do derivation 
   & querying of the default class key & salt. 
-  Behavior changes to the ``ainverse_int`` & ``inverse_int`` functions in the 
   ``generics`` module to allow handling bases represented in ``str`` or ``bytes`` 
   type strings. 
-  Behavior & name changes to the ``abinary_tree`` & ``binary_tree`` functions in the 
   ``generics`` module to ``abuild_tree`` & ``build_tree``. They now allow making 
   uniform trees of any width & depth, limited only by the memory in a 
   user's machine. 
-  Provided new ``acsprbg`` & ``csprbg`` objects to the library that return 512-bits 
   of cryptographically secure pseudo-random ``bytes`` type strings. They are 
   made by the new ``abytes_seeder`` & ``bytes_seeder`` generators. 
-  The ``csprng``, ``acsprng``, ``csprbg`` & ``acsprbg`` objects were 
   wrapped in functions that automatically restart the generators if they're
   stalled / interrupted during a call. This keeps the package from melting
   down if it can no longer call the CSPRNGs for new entropy.
-  Cleaned up & simplified ``table_key`` functions in the ``keygens`` module. 
-  Changed the output of ``asafe_symm_keypair`` & ``safe_symm_keypair`` functions 
   to contain bytes values not their hex-only representation. Also removed 
   these functions from the main imports of the package since they are slow 
   & their main contribution is calling ``arandom_number_generator`` & 
   ``random_number_generator`` to utilize a large entropy pool when starting
   CSPRNGs.
-  Added new values to the ``bits`` dictionary.
-  Added ``apad_bytes``, ``pad_bytes``, ``adepad_bytes`` & ``depad_bytes``
   functions which use ``shake_256`` to pad/depad plaintext bytes to & from
   multiples of 256 bytes. They take in a key to create the padding. 
   This method is intended to also aid in protecting against padding
   oracle attacks.




Changes for version 0.12.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  The OPAKE protocol was renamed to ROPAKE, an acronym for Ratcheting 
   Opaque Password Authenticated Key Exchange. This change was necessary 
   since OPAKE is already a name for an existing PAKE protocol. This change 
   also means the ``Opake`` class name was changed to ``Ropake``. 
-  The ``Ropake`` class' registration algorithm was slightly modified to 
   use the generated Curve25519 ``shared_key`` an extra time in the key 
   derivation process. This shouldn't break any currently authenticated 
   sessions. 
-  The ``asyncio_contextmanager`` package is no longer a listed dependency 
   in ``setup.py``. The main file from that package was copied over into the 
   ``/aiootp`` directory in order to remove the piece of code that caused 
   warnings to crop up when return values were retrieved from async 
   generators. This change will put an end to this whack-a-mole process of 
   trying to stop the warnings with try blocks scattered about the codebase. 
-  Added ``asave_tag``, ``save_tag``, ``asave_file`` & ``save_file`` methods 
   to the database classes so that specific entries can be saved to disk 
   without having to save the entire database which is much more costly. The 
   manifest file isn't saved to disk when these methods are used, so if a 
   tag file isn't already saved in the database, then the saved files will 
   not be present in the manifest or in the cache upon subsequent loads of 
   the database. The saved file will still however be saved on the 
   filesystem, though unbeknownst to the database instance.
-  The ``Namespace`` class now redacts all obvious key material in instance 
   repr's, which is any 64+ hex character string, or any number with 64+ 
   decimal digits. 
-  Removed the experimental recursive value retrieval within ``Comprende``'s 
   ``__aexamine_sent_exceptions`` & ``__examine_sent_exceptions`` methods. 
   This change leads to more reliable & faster code, in exchange for an 
   unnecessary feature being removed. 
-  Bug fix of the ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` methods by editing the code in 
   the ``asyncio_contextmanager`` dependency & using the patched package 
   instead of the ``comprehension`` decorator for the ``arelay`` & ``relay`` 
   methods of ``Comprende``. Their internal algorithms was also updated to 
   be simpler, but are incompatible with the outputs of past versions of 
   these methods. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various refactorings & documentation additions / modifications throughout 
   the library. 
-  Various small bug fixes.
-  The shared keys derived from the ``Ropake`` protocol are now returned in 
   a ``Namespace`` object instead of a raw dictionary, which allows the 
   values to be retrieved by dotted &/or bracketed lookup. 
-  The ``atest_hmac`` & ``test_hmac`` algorithms / methods were made more 
   efficient & were refactored. Now they call ``atime_safe_equality`` &
   ``time_safe_equality`` internally, which are new methods that can apply
   the non-constant time but randomized timing comparisons on any pairs of
   values.




Changes for version 0.11.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  The Opake protocol was made greatly more efficient. This was done by 
   replacing the diffie-hellman verifiers with a hash & xor commit & reveal
   system. Most hashing was made more efficient my using quicker & smaller
   ``sha_512`` function instead of ``nc_512``, & streamlining the protocol.
-  The ``Opake.client`` & ``Opake.client_registration`` methods now take
   an instantiated client database instead of client credentials which 
   improves security, efficiency & usability. This change reduces the amount
   of exposure received by user passwords & other credentials. It also 
   simplifies usage of the protocol by only needing to carry around a 
   database instead of a slew of credentials, which is also faster, since
   the credentials are passed through the cpu & memory hard ``passcrypt``
   function everytime to open the database.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Heavy refactorings & documentation additions / modifications of the 
   ``Opake`` class. Removed the ``Opake.ainit_database`` & ``Opake.init_database``
   methods, & made the ``salt`` default argument parameter in 
   ``Opake.aclient_database``, ``Opake.client_database``, ``Opake.adb_login`` &
   ``Opake.db_login`` into a keyword only argument so any extra user defined
   ``credentials`` are able to be passed without specifying a salt.
-  The decorators for the ``Comprende.arelay`` & ``Comprende.relay`` methods 
   were changed from ``@asyncio_contextmanager.async_contextmanager`` to
   ``@comprehension()`` to stop that package from raising exceptions when
   we retrieve return values from async generators.




Changes for version 0.10.1 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added ``Processes`` & ``Threads`` classes to ``asynchs.py`` which abstract 
   spawning & getting return values from async & sync functions intended to 
   be run in threads, processes or pools of the former types. This simplifies 
   & adds time control to usages of processes & threads throughout the 
   library. 
-  Reduced the effectiveness of timing analysis of the modular exponentiation 
   in the ``Opake`` class' verifiers by making the process return values 
   only after discrete intervals of time. Timing attacks on that part of the 
   protocol may still be viable, but should be significantly reduced. 
-  Bug fix in ``Comprende`` which should take care of warnings raised from 
   the ``aiocontext`` package when retrieving async generator values by 
   raising ``UserWarning`` within them. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Heavy refactorings of the ``Opake`` class. 
-  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
-  Further add ``return_exceptions=True`` flag to gather calls in ``ciphers.py``. 
-  Added ``is_registration`` & ``is_authentication`` which take a client 
   hello message that begin the ``Opake`` protocol, & return ``False`` if 
   the message is not either a registration or authentication message, 
   respectively, & return ``"Maybe"`` otherwise, since these functions can't 
   determine without running the protocol whether or not the message is 
   valid. 




Changes for version 0.10.0 
-------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added a new oblivious, one-message, password authenticated key exchange 
   protocol class in ``aiootp.ciphers.Opake``. It is a first attempt at the 
   protocol, which works rather well, but may be changed or cleaned up in a 
   future update. 
-  Added the ``cryptography`` package as a dependency for elliptic curve 
   25519 diffie-hellman key exchange in the ``Opake`` protocol. 
-  Fix buggy data processing functions in ``generics.py`` module. 
-  Added ``silent`` flag to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` methods, which 
   allows their instances to finish initializing even if a file is missing 
   from the filesystem, normally causing a ``FileNotFoundError``. This makes 
   trouble-shooting corrupted databases easier. 
-  Added new ``aiootp.paths.SecurePath`` function which returns the path to 
   a unique directory within the database's default directory. The name of 
   the returned directory is a cryptographic value used to create & open the 
   default database used by the ``Opake`` class to store the cryptographic 
   salt that secures the class' client passwords. It's highly recommended 
   to override this default database by instantiating the Opake class with 
   a custom user-defined key. The instance doesn't need to be saved, since 
   all the class' methods are either class or static methods. The ``__init__`` 
   method only changes the class' default database to one opened with the 
   user-defined ``key`` &/or ``directory`` kwargs, & should really only be 
   done once at the beginning of an application. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various refactorings & cleanups around the package. 
-  Added ``Comprende`` class feature to return the values from even the 
   generators within an instance's arguments. This change better returns 
   values to the caller from chains of ``Comprende`` generators. 
-  Fixed ``commons.BYTES_TABLE`` missing values. 
-  Added ``commons.DH_PRIME_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` & ``commons.DH_GENERATOR_4096_BIT_GROUP_16`` 
   constants for use in the ``Opake`` protocol's public key verifiers. 
-  Added other values to the ``commons.py`` module. 
-  Added new very large no-collision hash functions to the ``generics.py`` 
   module used to xor with diffie-hellman public keys in the ``Opake`` class. 
-  Added new ``wait_on`` & ``await_on`` ``Comprende`` generators to ``generics.py`` 
   which waits for a queue or container to be populated & yields it whenever 
   it isn't empty. 




Changes for version 0.9.3 
------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Speed & efficiency improvements in the ``Comprende`` class & ``azip``. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various refactorings & code cleanups.
-  Added ``apop`` & ``pop`` ``Comprende`` generators to the library.
-  Switched the default character table in the ``ato_base``, ``to_base``, 
   ``afrom_base``, & ``from_base`` chainable generator methods from the 62
   character ``ASCII_ALPHANUMERIC`` table, to the 95 character ``ASCII_TABLE``.
-  Made the digits generators in ``randoms.py`` automatically create a new
   cryptographically secure key if a key isn't passed by a user.
-  Some extra data processing functions added to ``generics.py``.




Changes for version 0.9.2 
------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` instance methods to ``OneTimePad``,
   ``Keys``, & ``AsyncKeys`` classes. They produce password hashes that are
   not just secured by the salt & passcrypt algorithm settings, but also by
   their main symmetric instance keys. This makes passwords infeasible to
   crack without also compromising the instance's 512-bit key.


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Further improvements to the random number generator in ``randoms.py``.
   Made its internals less sequential thereby raising the bar of work needed
   by an attacker to successfully carry out an order prediction attack.
-  Added checks in the ``Passcrypt`` class to make sure both a salt & 
   password were passed into the algorithm.
-  Switched ``PermissionError`` exceptions in ``Passcrypt._validate_args``
   to ``ValueError`` to be more consistent with the rest of the class.
-  Documentation updates / fixes.




Changes for version 0.9.1 
------------------------- 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Now any falsey values for the ``salt`` keyword argument in the library's 
   ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, & 
   ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators, & other functions around the 
   library, will cause them to generate a new cryptographically secure 
   pseudo-random value for the salt. It formerly only did this when ``salt`` 
   was ``None``. 
-  The ``seeder`` & ``aseeder`` generators have been updated to introduce 
   512 new bits of entropy from ``secrets.token_bytes`` on every iteration 
   to ensure that the CSPRNG will produce secure outputs even if its 
   internal state is somehow discovered. This also allows for simply calling 
   the CSPRNG is enough, there's no longer a strong reason to pass new 
   entropy into it manually, except to add even more entropy as desired.
-  Made ``size`` the last keywordCHECKSUMS.txt argument in ``encrypt`` & 
   ``aencrypt`` to better mirror the signatures for rest of the library. 
-  Added ``token_bits`` & ``atoken_bits`` functions to ``randoms.py`` which 
   are renamings of ``secrets.randbits``. 
-  Refactored & improved the security og ``randoms.py``'s random number 
   generator. 




Changes for version 0.9.0 
------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added hmac codes to ciphertext for the following functions: ``json_encrypt``, 
   ``ajson_encrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_encrypt``, 
   ``Database.encrypt`` & ``AsyncDatabase.aencrypt``. This change greatly 
   increases the security of ciphertext by ensuring it hasn't been modified 
   or tampered with maliciously. One-time pad ciphertext is maleable, so 
   without hmac validation it can be changed to successfully allow 
   decryption but return the wrong plaintext. These functions are the 
   highest level abstractions of the library for encryption/decryption, 
   which made them excellent targets for this important security update. 
   As well, it isn't easily possible for the library to provide hmac codes 
   for generators that produce ciphertext, because the end of a stream of 
   ciphertext isn't known until after the results have left the scope 
   of library code. So users will need to produce their own hmac codes for 
   generator ciphertext unless we find an elegant solution to this issue. 
   These functions now all return dictionaries with the associated hmac 
   stored in the ``"hmac"`` entry. The bytes functions formerly returned 
   lists, now their ciphertext is available from the ``"ciphertext"`` entry. 
   And, all database files will have an hmac attached to them now. These 
   changes were designed to still be compatible with old ciphertexts but 
   they'll likely be made incompatible by the v0.11.x major release. 
-  Only truthy values are now valid ``key`` keyword arguments in the 
   library's ``keys``, ``akeys``, ``bytes_keys``, ``abytes_keys``, ``subkeys``, 
   & ``asubkeys`` infinite keystream generators. Also now seeding extra entropy 
   into ``csprng`` & ``acsprng`` when ``salt`` is falsey within them. 
-  Only truthy values are now valid for ``password`` & ``salt`` arguments in 
   ``apasscrypt``, ``passcrypt`` & their variants. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Updates to documentation & ``README.rst`` tutorials.
-  The ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments in ``sum_passcrypt`` &
   ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods were switched to keyword
   only arguments.




Changes for version 0.8.1 
------------------------- 


Major Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Added ``sum_passcrypt`` & ``asum_passcrypt`` chainable generator methods 
   to ``Comprende`` class. They cumulatively apply the passcrypt algorithm 
   to each yielded value from an underlying generator with the passcrypt'd 
   prior yielded result used as a salt. This allows making proofs of work, 
   memory & space-time out of iterations of the passcrypt algorithm very 
   simple. 


Minor Changes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

-  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed. 
-  Various refactorings of the codebase. 
-  Made ``kb``, ``cpu``, & ``hardness`` arguments into keyword only arguments 
   in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` classes. 
-  The ``length`` keyword argument in functions around the library was 
   changed to ``size`` to be consistent across the whole package. Reducing 
   the cognitive burden of memorizing more than one name for the same concept. 
-  Various efficiency boosts. 
-  Edits to ``README.rst``. 
-  Added ``encode_salt``, ``aencode_salt``, ``decode_salt`` & ``adecode_salt`` 
   functions to the library, which gives access to the procedure used to 
   encrypt & decrypt the random salt which is often the first element 
   produced in one-time pad ciphertexts. 
-  Added cryptographically secure pseudo-random values as default keys in 
   encryption functions to safeguard against users accidentally encrypting 
   data without specifying a key. This way, such mistakes will produce 
   ciphertext with an unrecoverable key, instead of without a key at all. 




Changes for version 0.8.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix ``test_hmac``, ``atest_hmac`` functions in the keys & database 
   classes. The new non-constant-time algorithm needs a random salt to be 
   added before doing the secondary hmac to prevent some potential exotic 
   forms of chosen plaintext/ciphertext attacks on the algorithm. The last 
   version of the algorithm should not be used. 
-  The ``Keys`` & ``AsyncKeys`` interfaces were overhauled to remove the 
   persistance of instance salts. They were intended to be updated by users 
   with the ``reset`` & ``areset`` methods, but that cannot be guaranteed 
   easily through the class, so it is an inappropriate interface since 
   reusing salts for encryption is completely insecure. The instances do
   still maintain state of their main encryption key, & new stateful methods
   for key generation, like ``mnemonic`` & ``table_key``, have been added.
   The ``state`` & ``astate`` methods have been removed.
-  Gave ``OneTimePad`` instances new stateful methods from the ``ciphers.py`` 
   module & ``keygens.py`` keys classes. Its instances now remember the main 
   symmetric key behind the ``key`` property & automatically passes it as a 
   keyword argument to the methods in ``OneTimePad.instance_methods``.


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Update ``CHANGES.rst`` file with the updates that were not logged for
   v0.7.1.
-  ``BYTES_TABLE`` was turned into a list so that the byte characters can 
   be retrieved instead of their ordinal numbers.




Changes for version 0.7.1
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix a mistake in the signatures of ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt. The args
   ``kb``, ``cpu`` & ``hardness`` were changed into keyword only arguments
   to mitigate user mistakes, but the internal calls to those functions were
   still using positional function calls, which broke the api. This issue
   is now fixed.




Changes for version 0.7.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Replaced usage of bare ``random`` module functions, to usage of an 
   instance of ``random.Random`` to keep from messing with user's settings 
   on that module. 
-  Finalized the algorithm for the ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions. 
   The algorithm is now provably memory & cpu hard with a wide security 
   margin with adequate settings. The algorithm isn't likely change with 
   upcoming versions unless a major flaw is found. 
-  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` 
   is now ``3`` & now directly determines how many hash iterations are done 
   for each element in the memory cache. This provides much more 
   responsiveness to users & increases the capacity to impact resource cost
   with less tinkering. 
-  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
   scheme which is not constant time, but which instead does not leak useful 
   information. It does this by not comparing the hmacs of the data, but of 
   a pair of secondary hmacs. The timing analysis itself is now dependant 
   on knowledge of the key, since any conclusions of such an analysis would 
   be unable correlate its findings with any supplied hmac without it. 
-  Added  ``test_hmac`` & ``atest_hmac`` to the database classes, & changed 
   their hmac algorithm from ``sha3_512`` to ``sha3_256``. 


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
-  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
-  Several fixes to inaccurate function signatures.
-  Added ``mnemonic`` & ``amnemonic`` key generators to ``keygens.py`` with
   a wordlist 2048 entries long. A custom wordlist can also be passed in.
-  Minor changes in ``Comprende`` to track down a bug in the functions that 
   use the asyncio_contextmanager package. It causes a warning when asking
   async generators to return (not yield) values.
-  Some refactoring of ``random_number_generator`` & ``arandom_number_generator``.




Changes for version 0.6.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Replaced the usage of ``os.urandom`` within the package with 
   ``secrets.token_bytes`` to be more reliable across platforms. 
-  Replaced several usages of ``random.randrange`` within ``randoms.py`` to 
   calls to ``secrets.token_bytes`` which is faster & more secure. It
   now also seeds ``random`` module periodically prior to usage.
-  Changed the internal cache sorting algorithm of ``passcrypt`` & 
   ``apasscrypt`` functions. The key function passed to ``list.sort(key=key)`` 
   now not only updates the ``hashlib.sha3_512`` proof object with 
   each element in the cache, but with it's own current output. This change 
   is incompatible with previous versions of the functions. The key function 
   is also trimmed down of unnecessary value checking. 
-  The default value for the ``cpu`` argument in ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``
   is now ``40_000``. This is right at the edge of when the argument begins
   impacting the cpu work needed to comptute the password hash when the ``kb``
   argument is the default of ``1024``.
-  Switched the ``AsyncKeys.atest_hmac`` & ``Keys.test_hmac`` methods to a 
   constant time algorithm.


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various code cleanups, refactorings & speedups.
-  Added a ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`` instance to the ``asynchs``
   module for easily spinning off threads. It's available under 
   ``asynchs.thread_pool``.
-  Added ``sort`` & ``asort`` chainable generator method to the ``Comprende`` 
   class. They support sorting by a ``key`` sorting function as well.
-  Changed the name of ``asynchs.executor_wrapper`` to ``asynchs.wrap_in_executor``.
-  Changed the name of ``randoms.non0_digit_stream``, ``randoms.anon0_digit_stream``,
   ``randoms.digit_stream`` & ``randoms.adigit_stream`` to ``randoms.non_0_digits``,
   ``randoms.anon_0_digits``, ``randoms.digits`` & ``randoms.adigits``.
-  Several fixes to inaccurate documentation.
-  ``apasscrypt`` & ``Passcrypt.anew`` now use the synchronous version of the 
   algorithm internally because it's faster & it doesn't change the 
   parallelization properties of the function since it's already run 
   automatically in another process.
-  Added ``shuffle``, ``ashuffle``, ``unshuffle``, & ``aunshuffle`` functions
   to ``randoms.py`` that reorder sequences pseudo-randomly based on their
   ``key`` & ``salt`` keyword arguments.
-  Fixed bugs in ``AsyncKeys`` & ``debuggers.py``.
-  Added ``debugger`` & ``adebugger`` chainable generator methods to the
   ``Comprende`` class which benchmarks & inspects running generators with
   an inline syntax.




Changes for version 0.5.1
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed a bug in the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` of the database classes 
   that assigned to a variable within a closure that was nonlocal but which 
   wasn't declared non-local. This caused an error which made the methods 
   unusable. 
-  Added ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt`` functions which are designed to be 
   tunably memory & cpu hard password-based key derivation function. It was 
   inspired by the scrypt protocol but internally uses the library's tools. 
   It is a first attempt at the protocol, it's internal details will likely 
   change in future updates. 
-  Added ``bytes_keys`` & ``abytes_keys`` generators, which are just like 
   the library's ``keys`` generator, except they yield the concatenated 
   ``sha3_512.digest`` instead of the ``sha3_512.hexdigest``. 
-  Added new chainable generator methods to the ``Comprende`` class for 
   processing bytes, integers, & hex strings into one another. 


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various code cleanups.
-  New tests added to the test suite for ``passcrypt`` & ``apasscrypt``.
-  The ``Comprende`` class' ``alist`` & ``list`` methods can now be passed
   a boolean argument to return either a ``mutable`` list directly from the 
   lru_cache, or a copy of the cached list. This list is used by the 
   generator itself to yield its values, so wilely magic can be done on the
   list to mutate the underlying generator's results. 




Changes for version 0.5.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added interfaces in ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` to handle encrypting
   & decrypting streams (``Comprende`` generators) instead of just raw json 
   data. They're methods called ``encrypt_stream``, ``decrypt_stream``,
   ``aencrypt_stream``, & ``adecrypt_stream``.
-  Changed the attribute ``_METATAG`` used by ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` 
   to name the metatags entry in the database. This name is smaller, cleaner 
   & is used to prevent naming collisions between user entered values & the 
   metadata the classes need to organize themselves internally. This change 
   will break databases from older versions keeping them from accessing their 
   metatag child databases.
-  Added the methods ``auuids`` & ``uuids`` to ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database``
   which return coroutines that accept potentially sensitive identifiers &
   turns them into salted ``size`` length hashes distinguished by a ``salt``
   & a ``category``.


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various code & logic cleanups / speedups.
-  Refactorings of the ``Database`` & ``AsyncDatabase`` classes.
-  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.




Changes for version 0.4.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed bug in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt`` function which inaccurately called
   a synchronous ``Comprende`` end-point method on the underlying async
   generator, causing an exception and failure to function.
-  Changed the procedures in ``akeys`` & ``keys`` that generate their internal
   key derivation functions. They're now slightly faster to initialize &
   more theoretically secure since each internal state is fed by a seed
   which isn't returned to the user. This encryption algorithm change is 
   incompatible with the encryption algorithms of past versions.


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Various code cleanups.
-  Various inaccurate docstrings fixed.
-  Keyword arguments in ``Keys().test_hmac`` & ``AsyncKeys().atest_hmac``
   had their order switched to be slightly more friendly to use.
-  Added documentation to ``README.rst`` on the inner workings of the
   one-time-pad algorithm's implementation.
-  Made ``Compende.arandom_sleep`` & ``Compende.random_sleep`` chainable
   generator methods.
-  Changed the ``Compende.adelimit_resize`` & ``Compende.delimit_resize``
   algorithms to not yield inbetween two joined delimiters in a sequence
   being resized.




Changes for version 0.3.1
-------------------------


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed bug where a static method in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` was 
   wrongly labelled a class method causing a failure to initialize.




Changes for version 0.3.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now use the more secure ``afilename`` 
   & ``filename`` methods to derive the hashmap name and encryption streams
   from a user-defined tag internal to their ``aencrypt`` / ``adecrypt`` / 
   ``encrypt`` / ``decrypt`` methods, as well as, prior to them getting called. 
   This will break past versions of databases' ability to open their files.
-  The package now has built-in functions for using the one-time-pad 
   algorithm to encrypt & decrypt binary data instead of just strings
   or integers. They are available in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt``, 
   ``aiootp.abytes_decrypt``, ``aiootp.bytes_encrypt`` & ``aiootp.bytes_decrypt``.
-  The ``Comprende`` class now has generators that do encryption & decryption 
   of binary data as well. They are available from any ``Comprende`` generator
   by the ``abytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_decrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt`` & ``bytes_decrypt`` 
   chainable method calls.
   
   
Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed typos and inaccuracies in various docstrings.
-  Added a ``__ui_coordination.py`` module to handle inserting functionality 
   from higher-level to lower-level modules and classes.
-  Various code clean ups and redundancy eliminations.
-  ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes now only update their ``self.salt`` key
   by default when their ``areset`` & ``reset`` methods are called. This
   aligns more closely with their intended use.
-  Added ``arandom_sleep`` & ``random_sleep`` chainable methods to the
   ``Comprende`` class which yields outputs of generators after a random 
   sleep for each iteration.
-  Added several other chainable methods to the ``Comprende`` class for
   string & bytes data processing. They're viewable in ``Comprende.lazy_generators``.
-  Added new, initial tests to the test suite.




Changes for version 0.2.0
-------------------------


Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added ephemeral salts to the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` file 
   encryption procedures. This is a major security fix, as re-encryption 
   of files with the same tag in a database with the same open key would 
   use the same streams of key material each time, breaking encryption if 
   two different versions of a tag file's ciphertext stored to disk were 
   available to an adversary. The database methods ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``, 
   ``aencrypt`` & ``adecrypt`` will now produce and decipher true one-time 
   pad ciphertext with these ephemeral salts. 
-  The ``aiootp.subkeys`` & ``aiootp.asubkeys`` generators were revamped 
   to use the ``keys`` & ``akeys`` generators internally instead of using 
   their own, slower algorithm. 
-  ``AsyncDatabase`` file deletion is now asynchronous by running the 
   ``builtins.os.remove`` function in an async thread executor. The 
   decorator which does the magic is available at ``aiootp.asynchs.executor_wrapper``. 


Minor Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix typos in ``__root_salt`` & ``__aroot_salt`` docstrings. Also replaced 
   the ``hash(self)`` argument for their ``lru_cache``  & ``alru_cache`` 
   with a secure hmac instead. 
-  add ``gi_frame``, ``gi_running``, ``gi_code``, ``gi_yieldfrom``, 
   ``ag_frame``, ``ag_running``, ``ag_code`` & ``ag_await`` properties to 
   ``Comprende`` class to mirror async/sync generators more closely. 
-  Remove ``ajson_encrypt``, ``ajson_decrypt``, ``json_encrypt``, 
   ``json_decrypt`` functions' internal creation of dicts to contain the 
   plaintext. It was unnecessary & therefore wasteful. 
-  Fix docstrings in ``OneTimePad`` methods mentioning ``parent`` kwarg which 
   is a reference to deleted, refactored code. 
-  Fix incorrect docstrings in databases ``namestream`` & ``anamestream`` 
   methods.

_`Known Issues` ................................... `Table Of Contents`_
========================================================================

-  The test suite for this software is under construction, & what tests
   have been published are currently inadequate to the needs of
   cryptography software.
-  None of the hash functions in the public facing part of the library
   are to spec. This is because all inputs to the hash functions from
   the generics.py module are put into a tuple & stringified before
   hashing for user-friendliness, speed, readibility & the power of 
   being to hash any python object that has a repr. This behaviour is 
   purposeful, but can still be an issue.
-  This package is currently in beta testing & active development.
