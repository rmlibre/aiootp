=================

-  The test suite for this software is under construction, & what tests
   have been published are currently inadequate to the needs of
   cryptography software.
-  This package is currently in beta testing. Contributions are welcome.

``Changelog``
=============


Changes for version 0.3.1
=========================


Minor Changes
-------------

-  Fixed bug where a static method in ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` was 
   wrongly labelled a class method causing a failure to initialize.




Changes for version 0.3.0
=========================


Major Changes
-------------

-  The ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` now use the more secure ``afilename`` 
   & ``filename`` methods to derive the hashmap name and encryption streams
   from a user-defined tag internal to their ``aencrypt`` / ``adecrypt`` / 
   ``encrypt`` / ``decrypt`` methods, as well as, prior to them getting called. 
   This will break past versions of databases' ability to open their files.
-  The package now has built-in functions for using the one-time-pad 
   algorithm to encrypt & decrypt binary data instead of just strings
   or integers. They are available in ``aiootp.abytes_encrypt``, 
   ``aiootp.abytes_decrypt``, ``aiootp.bytes_encrypt`` & ``aiootp.bytes_decrypt``.
-  The ``Comprende`` class now has generators that do encryption & decryption 
   of binary data as well. They are available from any ``Comprende`` generator
   by the ``abytes_encrypt``, ``abytes_decrypt``, ``bytes_encrypt`` & ``bytes_decrypt`` 
   chainable method calls.
   
   
Minor Changes
-------------

-  Fixed typos and inaccuracies in various docstrings.
-  Added a ``__ui_coordination.py`` module to handle inserting functionality 
   from higher-level to lower-level modules and classes.
-  Various code clean ups and redundancy eliminations.
-  ``AsyncKeys`` & ``Keys`` classes now only update their ``self.salt`` key
   by default when their ``areset`` & ``reset`` methods are called. This
   aligns more closely with their intended use.
-  Added ``arandom_sleep`` & ``random_sleep`` chainable methods to the
   ``Comprende`` class which yields outputs of generators after a random 
   sleep for each iteration.
-  Added several other chainable methods to the ``Comprende`` class for
   string & bytes data processing. They're viewable in ``Comprende.lazy_generators``.
-  Added new, initial tests to the test suite.




Changes for version 0.2.0
=========================


Major Changes
-------------

-  Added ephemeral salts to the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` file 
   encryption procedures. This is a major security fix, as re-encryption 
   of files with the same tag in a database with the same open key would 
   use the same streams of key material each time, breaking encryption if 
   two different versions of a tag file's ciphertext stored to disk were 
   available to an adversary. The database methods ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``, 
   ``aencrypt`` & ``adecrypt`` will now produce and decipher true one-time 
   pad ciphertext with these ephemeral salts. 
-  The ``aiootp.subkeys`` & ``aiootp.asubkeys`` generators were revamped 
   to use the ``keys`` & ``akeys`` generators internally instead of using 
   their own, slower algorithm. 
-  ``AsyncDatabase`` file deletion is now asynchronous by running the 
   ``builtins.os.remove`` function in an async thread executor. The 
   decorator which does the magic is available at ``aiootp.asynchs.executor_wrapper``. 


Minor Changes
-------------

-  Fix typos in ``__root_salt`` & ``__aroot_salt`` docstrings. Also replaced 
   the ``hash(self)`` argument for their ``lru_cache``  & ``alru_cache`` 
   with a secure hmac instead. 
-  add ``gi_frame``, ``gi_running``, ``gi_code``, ``gi_yieldfrom``, 
   ``ag_frame``, ``ag_running``, ``ag_code`` & ``ag_await`` properties to 
   ``Comprende`` class to mirror async/sync generators more closely. 
-  Remove ``ajson_encrypt``, ``ajson_decrypt``, ``json_encrypt``, 
   ``json_decrypt`` functions' internal creation of dicts to contain the 
   plaintext. It was unnecessary & therefore wasteful. 
-  Fix docstrings in ``OneTimePad`` methods mentioning ``parent`` kwarg which 
   is a reference to deleted, refactored code. 
-  Fix incorrect docstrings in databases ``namestream`` & ``anamestream`` 
   methods. 
-  Added ``ASYNC_GEN_THROWN`` constant to ``Comprende`` class to try to stop 
   an infrequent & difficult to debug ``RuntimeError`` when async generators 
   do not stop after receiving an ``athrow``. 
-  Database tags are now fully loaded when they're copied using the methods 
   ``into_namespace`` & ``ainto_namespace``. 
-  Updated inaccurate docstrings in ``map_encrypt``, ``amap_encrypt``, 
   ``map_decrypt`` & ``amap_decrypt`` ``OneTimePad`` methods. 
-  Added ``acustomize_parameters`` async function to ``aiootp.generics`` 
   module. 
-  Various code clean ups.
